description: A comprehensive summary and key takeaways from the Natural Law Knowledge Base.
---

## 1. Introduction
- Based on Mark Passio's Natural Law Seminar.
- Encourages personal research and verification - not blind belief.
- Understanding Natural Law creates a moral obligation to live by it and teach it.

## 2. Before We Begin
- This is esoteric, hidden knowledge.
- Truth is singular and eternal; perception must align with truth.
- Emotional reactions should not determine truthfulness.

## 3. Teachability
- Requires open-mindedness, balanced skepticism, and willingness to change.
- Institutions limit understanding by controlling information.
- Personal introspection is key to resonating with truth.

## 4. Requirements & the Role of Knowledge
- Desired conditions (happiness, freedom, peace) require specific knowledge and action.
- The “law of attraction” is about meeting requirements, not mere thought.
- Knowledge must lead to action.

## 5. Occult Knowledge
- “Occult” means hidden.
- Two Arcana:
  - **Lesser Arcana**: Human consciousness and psyche.
  - **Greater Arcana**: Natural Law (universal spiritual laws).

## 6. Natural Law
- “Natural” = related to spirit/God (from Egyptian *Neter*).
- Universal spiritual laws governing consequences for intelligent beings.
- Deliberately hidden to maintain power imbalances.

## 7. Nescience vs. Ignorance
- **Nescience**: Not knowing due to absent information (no blame).
- **Ignorance**: Wilfully ignoring available information (carries blame).
- Society is largely ignorant, not nescient.

## 8. Problem Solving
1. Recognize the problem.
2. Diagnose the cause (symptoms are effects).
3. Take action to rectify causes.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./problem-solving" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 9. Truth vs. Perception
- Truth is objective, unchanging, independent of perception.
- Consciousness is the ability to perceive truth.
- Higher consciousness = more frequent alignment with truth.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./truth-vs-perception" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 10. Solipsism
- Belief that only one's mind exists; denial of objective truth.
- Associated with Satanism and moral relativism.
- Prevents growth and responsibility.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./solipsism" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 11. Definition of Natural Law
- **Natural**: Inherent in nature, not man-made.
- **Law**: Binding, immutable condition.
- Testable via scientific method; a science, not a belief system.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./definition-of-natural-law" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 12. Discovery vs. Belief
- Natural Law is discovered, not believed.
- Does not require belief to operate (like gravity).

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./discovery-vs-belief" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 13. Consciousness and the Brain
- Consciousness = ability to recognize patterns/meaning.
- Expressions of consciousness:
  - Thoughts (creative force)
  - Emotions (internal expression)
  - Actions (physical result)
- Symbolized as the Holy Trinity.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./consciousness-and-the-brain" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 14. Brain Structure and Behavior
- Three brain complexes:
  - R-Complex (reptilian): survival
  - Limbic system (mammalian): emotion
  - Neocortex (human): higher thought
- Brain hemispheres:
  - Left: logic, analysis (masculine)
  - Right: creativity, intuition (feminine)
- Balance leads to true consciousness and morality.

2. **Correspondence**: As above, so below.
3. **Vibration**: Everything moves; matter is energy.
4. **Polarity**: Everything has an opposite.
5. **Rhythm**: Everything flows in cycles.
6. **Cause & Effect**: Every cause has an effect.
7. **Gender**: Masculine/feminine principles in all things.

## 21. Right vs. Wrong
- Right = correct/moral; Wrong = incorrect/immoral.
- Moral relativism is a Satanic tenet.

  1. Self-preservation above all
  2. Moral relativism
  3. Social Darwinism
  4. Eugenics

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./right-vs-wrong" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 22. Knowing Rights
- Rights are actions that are correct and moral.
- All beings have equal rights.
- Use **apophatic inquiry**: define rights by excluding harmful actions.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./knowing-rights" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 23. Natural Law Transgressions
- Harmful actions: Murder, rape, theft, trespass, coercion.
- All reduce to **theft** (taking property: life, rights, freedom, body).
- No victim = no crime.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./natural-law-transgressions" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 24. Taxation, Prohibition, Licenses & Permits
- **Taxation**: Theft, violence, slavery (coerced confiscation of property).
- **Prohibition**: Slavery (claim over another's body).
- **Licenses/Permits**: Slavery (claim over another's rights).
- None can be made right by delegation or law.

1. Sacred Feminine / Non-Aggression Principle: Do not initiate violence.
2. Sacred Masculine / Self-Defense Principle: Right to defend against violence.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./the-two-pillars-of-enlightenment" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 27. Ownership
- Rightful possession + control + responsibility.

## 31. Equality Under Natural Law
- Everyone has equal rights; rights are innate, not granted.
- Government = “mind control” (from Latin *gubernare* + *mens*).
- Authority is an illusion; belief in authority = belief in slavery.

<UButton variant="subtle" size="xs" to="./equality-under-natural-law" trailing-icon="i-local-arrow" color="neutral">Go to page</UButton>

## 32. The One True Divide

## 38. Self-Loathing vs. Self-Respect
- Self-loathing leads to abdication and order-following.
- Self-respect comes from introspection and responsibility.
- Necessary for moral adulthood.
