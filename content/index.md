    title: Principles of Natural Law
    description: Natural Law is expressed through seven basic 
    underlying principles, and the 8th Lost Principle which binds 
    the other seven together. These principles constitute as the 
    Master Key through which universal wisdom is unveiled.
    ---
  ```
  ```md

    ## The Principles

    ### Etymology
    The word **_Principle_** is derived from the Latin noun 
    **_Principia_** which means "First, Foremost, Leading, or 
    Most necessary". In other words, that which is most important.
