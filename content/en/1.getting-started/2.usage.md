::note
The Open Doctrine website is a blend of a structured knowledge base and a living reference. We recommend using the linear path for foundational learning and the search tool for the rest of your journey.

## The Two Modes of Use

The Open Doctrine website is designed for two primary modes, reflecting your stage of learning:

### The Linear Path

This is the Recommended study order. For a complete understanding, follow the chapters in the order presented in the **main navigation sidebar** under **[The Open Doctrine](/en/natural-law/introduction)**. This path is deliberately sequential. Each chapter builds upon concepts introduced in earlier ones.

::caution
**Do not skip around on your first pass.**
::

::note
Start with the **[Introduction](/en/natural-law/introduction)** and proceed to the next chapter by following the link in the end of each chapter. The sidebar will always show your **current position** and the **next chapter**.

### Search Mode

This is your primary research tool. The **Search bar in the top header** is your most powerful tool for reference and review.

::note
Click the search bar to open the search window. Alternatively, you can press `CTRL` + `K` to launch it.
::

::note
For immediate answers, start typing a related term in the search bar. Results will appear in real-time.

::tip
To browse the full structure, look at the **categorized site map** listed below the search bar. This shows you every page, organized by section. It's a great way for you to grasp the site's entire scope at a glance.

## Navigating a Chapter Page

Each chapter (e.g. [Teachability](/en/natural-law/teachability/)) is a self-contained study with integrated multimedia. Here’s what you’ll find and how to use it:

*   <u>**Chapter Title & Description:**</u> At the top. Read this to understand the chapter's core focus.
*   <u>**"On This Page" Navigation:**</u> Use these links to **jump instantly** to specific sections within the long chapter page.
*   <u>**The Integrated Content:**</u>
    *   **The Essay:** Chapter and study summary. Learn to understand.
    *   **Video:** An embedded player for the specific seminar portion. Click to play.
    *   **Transcript:** The written core of the chapter. This text elaborates on the video, providing definitions, context, and deeper explanations.
    *   **Slides:** Key visual aids from the video. **Click any slide to enlarge it** for detailed study.

## Using the Reference Sections

Once you grasp the core material, these sections become invaluable:

*   **[Glossary:](/en/reference/glossary)** Located under **Reference** in the global sidebar. Use this to find precise definitions of key terms.
*   **[Resources:](/en/reference/resources)** A curated list of external books, lectures, and tools related to Natural Law and the principles discussed here.
<!-- *   **[FAQ:](/en/reference/faq)** Answers to common questions about the project, the content, and the philosophy behind it. -->
