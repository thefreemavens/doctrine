You do not need to be a developer, a scholar, or a "perfect" writer. You only need attention and intent.

Not all contributions require technical skill. Select the path that aligns with your current capacity:

| **Role** | **Time** | **Skill** | **Action** |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|------------|
| **[Reader](#reader)** | 2 minutes | None | Report a typo, unclear phrase, or broken link |
| **[Proofreader](#proofreader)** | 10–30 minutes | Attentive reading | Suggest a clarification or improvement to existing text |
| **[Translator](#translator)** | Flexible | Bilingual proficiency | Begin a translation in your language |
| **[Developer](#developer)** | Variable | HTML/CSS/JS, Vue/Nuxt | Fix an open issue or improve functionality |
| **[Designer](#designer)** | Flexible | SVG, illustration, diagramming | Create or refine visual assets |

::tip
**Not sure where to start?** Begin with **Reader**. It requires zero setup and immediate impact.

### Reader

This is the fastest way to contribute and builds familiarity with the material.

1.  **Navigate** to any page in the Doctrine.
2.  **Find** something that could be improved:
    - A typographical error
    - A sentence that is unclear or ambiguous
    - A broken link or formatting issue
    - A concept that lacks sufficient explanation
3.  **Click** the "Report Issue" link (located in the enf of each page).
4.  **Describe** what you found and suggest an improvement.
5.  **Submit.** You have contributed.

::note
**Time:** 2 minutes.  
::

::tip
**Next:** You will receive notification when your issue is reviewed.

### Proofreader

If you have read through a section and feel it could be clearer, you can propose specific wording changes.

1.  Navigate to the page you wish to improve.
2.  Click the "Report Issue" link.
3.  Sign in to GitHub.
4.  In your description, include:
    - The exact sentence or paragraph
    - Why it is unclear
    - Your suggested revision
5.  Submit.

::note
**Time:** 10–30 minutes.  
::

::tip
**Next:** Your suggestion will be reviewed for alignment with the doctrinal framework and style guide.

### Translator

The Doctrine is designed for localization. Every page has a corresponding translation file.

1.  **Check** the [Translation Status Board](/en/contribute/translation/status) to see which languages are in progress.
2.  **Claim** a file or section (or simply begin translating and submit).
3.  **Translate** the content. Preserve all Markdown formatting and frontmatter.
4.  **Submit** via pull request or by opening an issue with your translation attached.

*New to translation work? Start with a single page—or even a single paragraph. Partial contributions are welcomed and credited.*

::note
**Time:** Flexible. A single page may take 20–60 minutes depending on language and familiarity.  
::

::tip
**Next:** Your translation will be reviewed by a native speaker and merged.  
::

---

### Developer

If you have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or the Nuxt framework, you can contribute directly to the platform itself.

1.  **Visit** the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/thefreemavens/doctrine/issues) page.
2.  **Filter** by label `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`.
3.  **Sign in** to GitHub and comment to indicate you are working on an issue.
4.  **Follow** the [Local Development Setup](/en/contribute/installation) guide to run the site locally.
5.  **Submit** your pull request.

::note
**Time:** Variable, typically 30 minutes to 2 hours for first issues.  
::

::tip
**Next:** Your code will be reviewed and merged by a maintainer.  
::

### Designer

The Doctrine requires a consistent geometric visual language. If you work with SVG, illustration, or diagramming, your contributions are needed.

**Examples of design contributions:**
- Icons representing the 8 principles
- Diagrams illustrating the Generative Chain (Care → Thought → Action → Reality)
- Visual explanations of the Hermetic principles
- Refinements to the Seed of Life and other geometric symbols

**How to contribute:**
1.  Create your asset (SVG format preferred).
2.  Open an issue on GitHub.
3.  Attach your asset and describe its intended use.
4.  A maintainer will review and provide feedback.

::note
**Time:** Flexible.  
::

::tip
**Next:** Your asset will be reviewed for style alignment and incorporated into the appropriate section.

## What Happens After You Contribute?

- **Your contribution is reviewed** for accuracy, clarity, and alignment.

## Still Uncertain?

**Ask a question.** The Collective maintains a dedicated [Contribution Discussion](https://discord.gg/your-invite) channel. You can observe, ask for guidance, or simply state your intent before acting.

No question is too basic. Every Maven began as a seeker.
