## Why Translation Matters

De-occultation cannot be complete while the Doctrine remains imprisoned in a single language. Every completed translation extends the reach of Natural Law to a population otherwise excluded from this knowledge.

This is not merely localization. It is liberation.

---

## Translation Board

The table below tracks the current status of all active language translations. Each language progresses through four stages:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Not Started** | No work has been initiated. Available for claiming. |
| **In Progress** | Actively being translated by one or more contributors. |
| **Review** | Translation complete; awaiting review by a native speaker. |
| **Published** | Fully reviewed and live on the Doctrine site. |

## How to Begin a Translation

1.  **Select a language** from the table above that is marked "Not Started" or "In Progress."
2.  **Click** the corresponding link to claim your language or section.
3.  **Download** the source Markdown files or work directly in Github.
4.  **Translate** the content, preserving all formatting and Frontmatter.
5.  **Submit** your work via pull request or by attaching the translated files to an issue.

::note
**Partial contributions are welcome.** You need not translate an entire language alone. Every paragraph brings the Doctrine closer to completion.

## Translation Guidelines

- **Preserve meaning, not word order.** Translate the idea, not the literal sequence.
- **Maintain all Markdown syntax.** Headers, links, lists, and Frontmatter must remain intact.
- **Do not alter the immutable.** Core definitions and principles must be rendered with precision.
- **When uncertain,** include a comment in your translation file noting the ambiguity.

::tip
**Review process:** Every translation undergoes review by a native speaker before publication. This ensures both accuracy and natural readability.

## Request a New Language

**Your language is not listed?** Open an issue requesting its addition. Include:

- Language name and ISO code
- Your willingness to contribute or coordinate
- Any existing translation work you have completed
