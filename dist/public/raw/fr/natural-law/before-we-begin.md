# Before We Begin...

> This guide is an initiation into very deeply esoteric material, that has been hidden from humanity for decades.

<note>

This first lesson is called before we begin, and "begin" is the key word here.

</note>

<tip>

If you feel that the current human condition and life on Earth are tolerable just the way they are, and you are content with our global situation as it is now, then there is nothing for you to find here.

</tip>

The information you will encounter in this guide as a whole, and lessons in parts, is not new information. While it will most likely be new to most who read it, all of this information can be found in numerous different books, seminars, and lectures written by numerous different people.

## Key Concepts & Requirements:

### 1. Put Feelings Aside

Some of you are likely to be angered by some of the things you are about to read, so be it. The fact of the matter is that truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent; because it “wages war” against all forms of falsehood and deception. If you wish to take away any real value from reading this guide, you should make a deliberate effort to be consciously aware of any impulses you may have to reject certain information presented, solely based on your initial emotional reaction to it.

### 2. Avoid Logical Fallacies

It is a logical fallacy to gauge the veracity (truthfulness) of any information based on how you feel when first hearing it; because you cannot “think” with the emotions. If you read something you don't like, or something that angers you, that's okay, feel the emotion.
But don't immediately tell yourself it can't be true.

### 3. Do Due Diligence

Of course you shouldn't just believe anything you read here either; it's about checking the information for yourself, and to actually start researching this material for yourself.
And this is a great place to start that journey.

### 4. Stay Objective

However, this entire guide is a tapestry. Like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle; it is meant to be seen and taken in as a whole, in its entirety.

### 5. Recognize Patterns

It is highly recommended that you read the entire guide from beginning to end, otherwise, you will most likely not recognize the patterns inherent to the tapestry.

### 6. Accept what is True

As the old saying goes: “There is nothing new under the sun.” This simply means that truth is singular and eternal. It has always been here and will always be here; it is our perceptions that must be aligned to it.

### Transcript + Slides

Okay, I want to say thanks to each and every one of you for being here today, it’s going to be a great day. I’m going to go through what I consider to be the very heart of my material. And people ask me a lot, they say; “you put out a lot of material on your website, what is the main thing? If you had to tell me what is the main thing that I should check out if I check out nothing else that’s up there, what would it be?” And I always tell them the same thing; it’s the material on Natural Law. If nothing else, that’s the material that you need to understand deeply. So that’s what we’re going to be covering here today in an extended presentation format. I want to go through a few things before we actually get started, so I call this section “before we begin.”

And the word begin is actually important here because that's what this presentation is actually about, it's initiation. This is an initiation into really, really deep, esoteric material that has been hidden from humanity for millennia.

(Slide 2) So, I just want to ask people before we get started, how many of you are new, or relatively new to my work by a show of hands please? That's excellent, this is great. That is great news, I am so glad to hear that. What I actually didn't want is to come hear and talk to a bunch of people who are already totally familiar with my work and have already heard it. So this is great.

(Slide 2.1) How many of you here today feel that the human condition and life on earth for humanity right now is tolerable just the that way that it is, by a show of hands? That's also pretty good because if that was the case, I was going to say there's nothing for here you today, there's the door. So that's good that we're all hungry for change. One of the big complaints I hear about my work, when I check in on forums or something or read some YouTube comments; many people will say “there's nothing new here, I've heard this before somewhere else, this person covers this, I've read this in this book.” Well ladies and gentlemen, I have news for you: there is nothing new here. I am not going to present anything new. I am not going to present anything that has not actually been in existence and will continue to be in existence. I'm not making up new material. I would refer to myself- Art (Capozzi) said it the other day, actually yesterday when we were having dinner; he said “I consider you an aggregator of material,” and I love that term, I love that description of what I do. I am an aggregator, I bring things together into a tapestry and then help to explain it in simple and easy-to-understand terms so that people can readily absorb it, take it in and do something with that information. (Slide 2.2) So, you will not be seeing or hearing anything “new” here today. As the old saying goes, in all the old mystery traditions, “there is nothing new under the sun.” And what that phrase actually means- many people don't know what that phrase means.   that the truth is singular and eternal. Truth has always been here, among us, and it will always be here. It is our perception that must be aligned with it. So there's nothing new you're going to hear today, okay. These are eternal truths that have always been here among us.

(Slide 3) Another aspect I want to cover before we get started is about my presentation style. This is another thing that I get a lot of complaints about and it's something I have no intention of changing. My presentation style has been described by some as extremely intense and at times, even combative. This is a word many people will use to describe my presentation style. Some of you here today are very likely to be angered by some of the things you may hear me say during the duration of this seminar, and I say so be it. That's okay. If you get angry that's okay. The fact of the matter is that Truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent. And I'll actually be putting up a quote to that nature later on in the presentation. The reason Truth is belligerent is because it is actually at war. It's at war with the lie, it's at war with deception, it's at war with mind control. So Truth can be belligerent. Many people don't want to hear it when they first encounter it. I tell people all the time: I don't do this, or I don't present this information to be liked. I don't do this to make friends. I'm not interested in making a whole bunch of new friends. If it happens, that's great, but that's not the reason I do what I do. I don't do this to be popular. I don't do this to make money. It's not a popularity contest. Telling people many things that they don't want to hear is not going to make you popular, or it's not going to make you a whole lot of new friends. So those aren't the reasons I do what I do. To be honest, I tell people this and sometimes they get upset by just hearing this; “I don't even really want to do this.” I don't want to do this with my life. I don't want to do this with my time. As I already know, understand and live the information I'm going to present. So I get this, I know this, okay. I don't need to keep going over this over and over and over again for my own entertainment. The reason that I actually do this is because I recognize that, in a time of such overwhelming ignorance of this critical information, this information which is capable of saving humanity from it's current condition. The fact that I do already understand this information places me in a position of moral obligation and responsibility. That's why I do what I do. I'm in a position of moral obligation to speak this information to other people in an effort to help to get them to understand it and live it as well. And that is the reason I do this.

(Slide 4) Every person here today who wishes to take real world value, practical value from this seminar here today, I'm going to ask them to make a deliberate and conscious effort to do two things. The first is, try to set aside, to the extent that you capable of doing so, you're perceptions of me as the presenter. This includes things like how you think I look, how I dress, the sound of my voice, my mannerisms, etc. Try to set those things aside to the extent that you are able to do it. I know that is difficult for some and I say this because paying attention to such trivialities will detract your own mental focus away from the information that is being presented today. And that's the worst thing that could happen because it is the information that is important, not me. Try to ignore me and focus on the content.The second thing I ask people to try to do is to be consciously aware, of any of your own impulses that you may have here today to immediately reject the information that is being presented in this seminar based solely upon your own initial emotional reaction, your initial emotional response to this information. This is a logical fallacy: you cannot think with the emotions, so if you hear something you don't like, or that angers you, that's ok. Feel the emotion, but don't just immediately say “that can't be true.” But don't believe me either. It's about checking it. It's about a process of truth discovery. It's about doing your own due diligence and actually researching this material. But if you try to gauge the veracity, meaning the truthfulness of this information solely based upon on how it makes you feel when hearing it, you are committing a logical fallacy. So I ask people to try as much as possible to suspend immediate reactions of disbelief and saying “no, I don't want to accept that, no it can't be true” based on how something may make you feel that you hear today. That's very important to keep in mind.

(Slide 5) And lastly, this information, the entire seminar, is a tapestry. It's like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle. It is meant to be seen and taken as a whole in its entirety. Now I know I'm asking a lot here too because it's going to be a long day. My goal here, my work here is to keep your interest and your attention and your focus throughout the entire course of this seminar, and that's a challenging thing to do. What I'm asking people is, you have to try to see it as a whole because if you took the time to be here and gave a monetary donation to be here, I'm highly recommending that you stay for the whole duration of the seminar. There's a reason for that; you're only going to get the full tapestry, especially if you're new to my work, by hearing this information in its entirety. So if you don't do that, you probably won't recognize the patterns, which is what this is all about. That's what this day is all about, pattern recognition, that are inherent to this tapestry of information and more likely than not, you'll have wasted the time it took for you to be here today and wasted the money you spent to be here today. So I don't want anybody to waste their time and their money and their attention, and I don't think you do either. So that's why I'm asking people, stay for the whole thing; you'll get the maximum value out of this seminar if you stay for its duration. So with that having been said, let's jump into the material.

(Slide 6) This presentation is called Natural Law: The Real Law of Attraction and how to apply it in your life. And I emphasize that term real law of attraction. Many people will be familiar with the new age variants of the so-called law or laws of attraction. This is going to differ quite widely from what people have heard in the new age community and the new age movement regarding what the law or laws of attraction are. These are the real laws of attraction we're going to be hearing today and hopefully understanding today. Let's start in.
