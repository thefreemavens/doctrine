# Principles of Natural Law

> Natural Law is expressed through seven basic underlying principles, and the 8th Lost Principle which binds the other seven together. These principles constitute as the Master Key through which universal wisdom is unveiled.

## The Principles

### Etymology

The word **Principle** is derived from the Latin noun **Principia** which means "First, Foremost, Leading, or Most necessary". In other words, that which is most important.

**These are the eight principles of Natural Law:**

These are also known as the "Hermetic Principles", derived from the name of the Greek God: **Hermes** (Ερμής), who was called the "Messenger of the Gods."

## Mentalism

<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-mentalism">

</div>

**All is mind; the universe is mental.** Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create, by being responsible for everything you think.

## Correspondence

</div>

**As above so below.** That which is above is like to that which is below, that which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of one another. The universe is self-similar across all scales.

## Vibration

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-vibration">

</div>

**Nothing rests, everything moves.** At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no 'solidity' as such; the universe is 'holographic.' Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration.

---

## Polarity

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-polarity">



</icon>
</div>

**Everything is dual, everything has poles.** Everything has its opposite. Opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled.

---

## Rhythm

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-rhythm">



</icon>
</div>

**Everything flows; out and in, in and out.** Everything has its tides. All things rise and fall. The pendulum swing manifests in everything. The measure of the swing to the right, is the measure of the swing to the left. Rhythm compensates.

## Causality

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-causality">



</icon>
</div>

**Cause and effect.** Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law. Chance is but a name for law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why Natural Law is also sometimes referred to as Consequentialism.

## Gender

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-gender">



</icon>
</div>

**Gender is in everything.** Everything has its masculine and feminine properties; gender manifests on all planes. While every person has a biological sex, psychologically both qualities exist simultaneously within everyone, and everything.

---

## Care

<div className="my-8,w-full,h-48,md:h-72,flex,justify-center,items-center,aspect-video,bg-neutral-500/10,rounded-2xl">
<icon className="size-32,md:size-48,text-primary" name="i-local-picon-care">



</icon>
</div>

**Care, not compassion.** Whatever you give attention to, and help to grow. This does not mean you shouldn't care for any negative things happening in the world because you think that will feed into it and give power to it; if that happens only ignorance is being fed into it. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it will occur. The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality.

<note>

What we care about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions.

</note>

What we as conscious beings need to develop are heart, mind, and guts, in that order. We must care enough to know, and then act accordingly to that understood knowledge. All three must be in place to gain unity consciousness; unifying thoughts, emotions, and actions. Therefore, care can be seen as the ultimate generator of the quality of our experience of life.

Hence the 8<sup>

th

</sup>

 principle is also known as the generative principle. True care is created in our hearts, the 'pump' that causes our blood to flow through our body, in many ancient traditions they spoke of the 'life force' being in the blood. As important as the brain is, the heart is ultimately generating the experience. Because what we care about becomes what we think about, and therefore, how we behave.

That which we care enough about to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created in our world. The reason the world is in the state it's in, is because most people do not care enough (even if they say they want things to be different) to change it through their behavior.

## The Lost Principle

The principle of Care is also referred to as the Lost Principle. This principle encapsulates all seven other principles; if you look at the seven circles that form the seed of life, the 8<sup>

th

</sup>

 added circle forms the outer shell. Without this shell present and intact, the creative (generative) essence of the seed will be lost.
