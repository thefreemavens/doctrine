# Teaching Natural Law to Others

> Teaching Natural Law to others is the Great Work.

<tip>

Knowledge is the only solution; and the propagation of that knowledge is Education.

## Education

The word **Education** derives from the Latin verb **Educere** means "to Take, to Draw, or to Lead out from". Leading a person out of darkness (ignorance) is what a real teacher does.

Rather than “pushing” a person out of that darkness, the teacher will go first and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accurate path, that person can follow the same discovery process.

<note>

This education process must be a repeatable process; as was mentioned earlier, Natural Law isn't a religion or a belief system, it is a science.
