 was "Hidden".

Derived from the Latin adjective *Occultus* which means "concealed, hidden from sight", which is in turn derived from the Latin verb *Occultare* which means "to keep secret, to conceal." Just like in English, the word *Ocular* means "related to the eye, related to sight", which is derived from the Latin noun *Oculus* meaning "Eye".
