# Ownership

> The main reason our species continues to experience a systematic and growing loss of freedom is because we collectively do not deeply understand ownership, and we continue to commit and condone theft.

## Ownership Meaning

To own something means that, regarding that thing, an individual maintains:

1. Rightful possession (acquired without doing somebody else harm)
2. Control of usage
3. Maintaining personal responsibility.

<tip>

Natural Law can essentially be reduced to a single spiritual law: **Do Not Steal**.

## All Rights Are Property Rights

We have to collectively understand that all rights are property rights. Stop taking the property of other beings, and stop condoning the taking of property of other beings.
