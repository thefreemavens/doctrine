# Conclusion

> Each individual has to make that decision for themselves, and that will eventually be expressed in the aggregate.

> “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the law of Nature for his rule."

If we want the forces of Nature on our side we must learn, and adhere to, the principles of Natural Law. If we do not align our behavior to it, Nature will not stand with us, but will continuously stand against us, and that will create more strife and suffering in our lives.

## The Master Key

This process should be able to be done a lot faster than a few hundred years; if we accept the master key that is shown in this guide. Which has the power to unlock all the locks, and all the doors, to all the mental cages, if we make the decision to climb the "ladder of consciousness" through an act of our own free will choice and effort. Because for most it won't be an easy process; it involves a lot of deep introspective work.

However, if we do this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves, by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine forces within each one of us. And by recognizing our own inherent sovereignty, and recognizing there isn't, and never has been any legitimacy to slavery, control, authority or any other form of external rulership of human beings as subjects.

## Justice

The tarot card pictured here was also shown at the beginning of this guide. There is a deep connection to be understood about the tarot tradition and other mystery traditions regarding knowledge of Natural Law. Specifically, the deeply interwoven relationship to the Middle-Eastern Kabbalistic tradition.

This tarot card is known as the Justice Card (Justice: based on the Latin word **Jus** meaning "Right or Law"). This card represents balance between the two pillars of Enlightenment (Feminine and Masculine), Holding the sword of truth in the right hand, and the scales of justice perfectly balanced in the left hand.

This Justice card represents sovereignty, alignment with truth, and the manifestation of order, which can only happen when we align our behaviors to the principles of Natural Law.

## True Freedom

If we let go of the habits that are holding us back and break the mental chains of bondage, we can create a world that is based on true freedom. It may be a difficult journey, but it can be done. And if we all choose to do so, we're going to see advances and creations beyond what we have ever experienced here on Earth. The world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of Natural Law. The changes we will experience are going to be so positive, and so transformative that we can barely even imagine what the world will look like on the other side of that work.

It is up to each and every one of us, personally, to take on that responsibility and go down that path for ourselves; should we hope to ever reach that point. The main task now is to inform as many people as possible about the workings of Natural Law, true morality, and freedom.
