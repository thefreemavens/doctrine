# Introduction

## De-Occultation is our purpose

For centuries, the core principles governing reality, consciousness, and morality have been fragmented, obscured, or guarded as "occult" (hidden) knowledge. This has created systems of control, confusion, and dependence.

Our mission is **de-occultation**. We make this knowledge whole, clear, and permanently accessible. We hold that understanding the immutable laws of nature is the prerequisite for individual sovereignty and a free society. This is not a matter of belief, but of demonstrable truth.

## What this repository contains

::tip
The Doctrine is built upon seminal work and is a comprehensive synthesis of 

**Natural Law**

 and 

**Hermetic**

 wisdom.
::

Here you will find:

::card-group{.my-12}
  :::card{icon="i-local-book-open-text" title="The Core Transcripts"}
  The complete, verbatim text of the foundational teachings, carefully segmented and annotated for study.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-lock-open" title="The Principles Decrypted"}
  Clear explanations of the universal operating principles, including the seven Hermetic laws and the generative eighth principle of **Care**.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-scale" title="The Framework of Natural Law"}
  An objective exploration of morality, rights, freedom, and the consequences of human action, derived from first principles.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-crown" title="The Path of Sovereignty"}
  Guidance on internal alignment ("The Internal Monarchy") and the external moral obligation ("The Great Work").
  :::
::

## Immutable Truth, Living Repository

::note
The 

**principles**

 documented here are immutable. They do not change, evolve, or submit to opinion. They are the consistent laws upon which reality operates.
::

This **repository**, however, is a living project. While the core truth is fixed, our collective understanding, expression, and accessibility of it can always improve. This site is built for that purpose: to be clarified, translated, and expanded upon by a global community.

## Two Ways to Engage

1. **Read and Learn:** This is first and foremost a library. Use the navigation to study the material sequentially or explore specific topics. It is freely available to all.
2. **Contribute and Steward:** This is also an open-source project. If you are skilled in translation, writing, or code, you can help improve the clarity, reach, and utility of this knowledge for everyone. See our [Contribution Guide](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/contribute/introduction) to begin.

## The Freemavens Collective

This Doctrine is the foundational text for **The Freemavens Collective**. The Collective is the community of practice - where individuals apply this knowledge, support each other's growth, and collaborate on the "Great Work" of education and elevation.

Think of it this way:

- **The Doctrine is the map.**
- **The Collective is the expedition.**

You are welcome to study the map on your own. If you seek fellowship, structured guidance, and active projects, you are invited to [join the expedition](https://thefreemavens.org){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}.

## A Final Word

This project is an act of restoration. It is an attempt to return a vital piece of humanity's operating manual to the public domain. We proceed with humility toward the truth and responsibility toward each other.

Thank you for being here. Your attention is the first step.

**Proceed to [Usage](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/getting-started/usage) for a guide to this repository of knowledge, or begin exploring the [Open Doctrine of Natural Law](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/natural-law/summary).**


# Usage

## The Two Modes of Use

This site is designed for two primary modes, reflecting your stage of learning:

1. **The Linear Path (For First-Time Study):** Follow the chapters in sequence to build a complete understanding.
2. **The Reference Mode (For Review & Research):** Use the search and reference sections to find specific concepts.

## 1. Starting the Linear Path: The Recommended Study Order

For a complete understanding, follow the chapters in the order presented in the **main navigation sidebar*&#x2A; under &#x2A;*"Study the Doctrine."** This path is deliberately sequential; each chapter builds upon concepts introduced in earlier ones.

- **Do not skip around on your first pass.** Start with the **Introduction** and proceed step-by-step.
- The sidebar will always show your **current position** and the **next chapter**.
- Tip: Use your browser's bookmark function to save your progress.

## 2. Navigating a Chapter Page

Each chapter (e.g., "Principle of Care") is a self-contained unit with integrated multimedia. Here’s what you’ll find and how to use it:

- **Chapter Title & Description:** At the top. Read this to understand the chapter's core focus.
- **"On This Page" Side Navigation:** On the right (or left on mobile). Use these links to **jump instantly** to specific sections within the long chapter page, such as the video segment, key slides, or transcript analysis.
- **The Integrated Content:**
  - **Video Segment:** An embedded player for the specific seminar portion. Click to play.
  - **Slides:** Key visual aids from the video. **Click any slide to enlarge it** for detailed study.
  - **Transcript & Essay:** The written core of the chapter. This text elaborates on the video, providing definitions, context, and deeper explanation.

## 3. Using the Search System (Your Primary Research Tool)

The **search icon (🔍) in the top header** is your most powerful tool for reference and review.

1. **Click the search icon** to open the search modal.
2. **For Immediate Answers:** Start typing a term (e.g., "Care," "Mentalism," "spiritual currency") in the search bar. Results will appear in real-time.
3. **To Browse the Full Structure:** Look at the **categorized site map** listed below the search bar. This shows you every page, organized by section (Getting Started, Study the Doctrine, Reference, Contribute). It's the perfect way to grasp the site's entire scope at a glance.

## 4. Using the Reference Sections

Once you grasp the core material, these sections become invaluable:

- **Glossary:** Located under **Reference** in the main nav. Use this to find precise definitions of key terms like "De-occultation," "Generative Principle," or "The Great Work."
- **Resources:** A curated list of external books, lectures, and tools related to Natural Law and the principles discussed here.
- **FAQ:** Answers to common questions about the project, the content, and the philosophy behind it.

## 5. Getting Involved: The Contribution Path

If you wish to move from study to stewardship - by translating, clarifying text, or reporting issues - all the practical guides are in the **Contribute** section. Start with the [Contribution Overview](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/contribute/introduction) page.

## Quick Start Checklist

- **First-time visitor?** Start with the [Introduction](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/natural-law/introduction) and follow the linear path.
- **Looking for a specific concept?** Use the &#x2A;*Search (🔍)** function in the header.
- **Need a definition?** Check the [Glossary](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary).
- **Want to help improve the site?** Visit the [Contribute](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/contribute/introduction) section.

---

*This site is a blend of a structured course and a living reference. We recommend using the linear path for foundational learning and the search/reference tools for the rest of your journey.*

---

This page now directly addresses both user types with clear instructions tailored to your site's specific features (linear nav, search modal, chapter layout). It should significantly reduce confusion and support effective learning.

# Introduction

::tip
You are free to share this guide with as many people you like. It is crucial to our freedom that more people will be exposed to this great body of knowledge and act on it.
::

::note
As a whole, the body of knowledge presented here has the potential to save humanity from its current state of slavery

## Definitions & Key Concepts:

### Natural Law

Natural Law is a set of universal, objective, eternal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions which govern the consequences of behaviors of beings with the capacity for understanding the difference between harmful and non-harmful actions.

### Objective Morality

The understanding of Natural Law is centred upon bringing one's own conscience into alignment with objective morality. This means definitively knowing which behaviors are rights; because they do not cause harm to other sentient beings, and which behaviors are wrongs because they do cause harm to other sentient beings.

### Exercising Conscience

Living in harmony with Natural Law means exercising conscience, and wilfully choosing morally right behavior over morally wrong behavior, once the difference between the two is clearly understood.

### Cause & Effect

When people begin to live in harmony with Natural Law in the aggregate, and are therefore
moral, they become and remain free. When people live in opposition to Natural Law, and are
therefore immoral, they become and remain enslaved.

### Positive Change

If you want to come to a proper understanding of what Natural Law is exactly, and how it
works in the world around you. If you wonder how it came to be that relatively small groups
of people calling themselves governments control the lives of billions of people worldwide.
If you want to definitively know the difference between right and wrong behavior, and make
a positive change in your own life and the lives of the people around you, this will be of
interest to you.

# Before We Begin...

::note
This first lesson is called before we begin, and "begin" is the key word here.
::

::tip
If you feel that the current human condition and life on Earth are tolerable just the way they are, and you are content with our global situation as it is now, then there is nothing for you to find here.

The information you will encounter in this guide as a whole, and lessons in parts, is not new information. While it will most likely be new to most who read it, all of this information can be found in numerous different books, seminars, and lectures written by numerous different people.

## Key Concepts & Requirements:

### 1. Put Feelings Aside

Some of you are likely to be angered by some of the things you are about to read, so be it. The fact of the matter is that truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent; because it “wages war” against all forms of falsehood and deception. If you wish to take away any real value from reading this guide, you should make a deliberate effort to be consciously aware of any impulses you may have to reject certain information presented, solely based on your initial emotional reaction to it.

### 2. Avoid Logical Fallacies

It is a logical fallacy to gauge the veracity (truthfulness) of any information based on how you feel when first hearing it; because you cannot “think” with the emotions. If you read something you don't like, or something that angers you, that's okay, feel the emotion.
But don't immediately tell yourself it can't be true.

### 3. Do Due Diligence

Of course you shouldn't just believe anything you read here either; it's about checking the information for yourself, and to actually start researching this material for yourself.
And this is a great place to start that journey.

### 4. Stay Objective

However, this entire guide is a tapestry. Like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle; it is meant to be seen and taken in as a whole, in its entirety.

### 5. Recognize Patterns

It is highly recommended that you read the entire guide from beginning to end, otherwise, you will most likely not recognize the patterns inherent to the tapestry.

### 6. Accept what is True

As the old saying goes: “There is nothing new under the sun.” This simply means that truth is singular and eternal. It has always been here and will always be here; it is our perceptions that must be aligned to it.

### Transcript + Slides

Okay, I want to say thanks to each and every one of you for being here today, it’s going to be a great day. I’m going to go through what I consider to be the very heart of my material. And people ask me a lot, they say; “you put out a lot of material on your website, what is the main thing? If you had to tell me what is the main thing that I should check out if I check out nothing else that’s up there, what would it be?” And I always tell them the same thing; it’s the material on Natural Law. If nothing else, that’s the material that you need to understand deeply. So that’s what we’re going to be covering here today in an extended presentation format. I want to go through a few things before we actually get started, so I call this section “before we begin.”

And the word begin is actually important here because that's what this presentation is actually about, it's initiation. This is an initiation into really, really deep, esoteric material that has been hidden from humanity for millennia.

(Slide 2) So, I just want to ask people before we get started, how many of you are new, or relatively new to my work by a show of hands please? That's excellent, this is great. That is great news, I am so glad to hear that. What I actually didn't want is to come hear and talk to a bunch of people who are already totally familiar with my work and have already heard it. So this is great.

(Slide 2.1) How many of you here today feel that the human condition and life on earth for humanity right now is tolerable just the that way that it is, by a show of hands? That's also pretty good because if that was the case, I was going to say there's nothing for here you today, there's the door. So that's good that we're all hungry for change. One of the big complaints I hear about my work, when I check in on forums or something or read some YouTube comments; many people will say “there's nothing new here, I've heard this before somewhere else, this person covers this, I've read this in this book.” Well ladies and gentlemen, I have news for you: there is nothing new here. I am not going to present anything new. I am not going to present anything that has not actually been in existence and will continue to be in existence. I'm not making up new material. I would refer to myself- Art (Capozzi) said it the other day, actually yesterday when we were having dinner; he said “I consider you an aggregator of material,” and I love that term, I love that description of what I do. I am an aggregator, I bring things together into a tapestry and then help to explain it in simple and easy-to-understand terms so that people can readily absorb it, take it in and do something with that information. (Slide 2.2) So, you will not be seeing or hearing anything “new” here today. As the old saying goes, in all the old mystery traditions, “there is nothing new under the sun.” And what that phrase actually means- many people don't know what that phrase means. that the truth is singular and eternal. Truth has always been here, among us, and it will always be here. It is our perception that must be aligned with it. So there's nothing new you're going to hear today, okay. These are eternal truths that have always been here among us.

(Slide 3) Another aspect I want to cover before we get started is about my presentation style. This is another thing that I get a lot of complaints about and it's something I have no intention of changing. My presentation style has been described by some as extremely intense and at times, even combative. This is a word many people will use to describe my presentation style. Some of you here today are very likely to be angered by some of the things you may hear me say during the duration of this seminar, and I say so be it. That's okay. If you get angry that's okay. The fact of the matter is that Truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent. And I'll actually be putting up a quote to that nature later on in the presentation. The reason Truth is belligerent is because it is actually at war. It's at war with the lie, it's at war with deception, it's at war with mind control. So Truth can be belligerent. Many people don't want to hear it when they first encounter it. I tell people all the time: I don't do this, or I don't present this information to be liked. I don't do this to make friends. I'm not interested in making a whole bunch of new friends. If it happens, that's great, but that's not the reason I do what I do. I don't do this to be popular. I don't do this to make money. It's not a popularity contest. Telling people many things that they don't want to hear is not going to make you popular, or it's not going to make you a whole lot of new friends. So those aren't the reasons I do what I do. To be honest, I tell people this and sometimes they get upset by just hearing this; “I don't even really want to do this.” I don't want to do this with my life. I don't want to do this with my time. As I already know, understand and live the information I'm going to present. So I get this, I know this, okay. I don't need to keep going over this over and over and over again for my own entertainment. The reason that I actually do this is because I recognize that, in a time of such overwhelming ignorance of this critical information, this information which is capable of saving humanity from it's current condition. The fact that I do already understand this information places me in a position of moral obligation and responsibility. That's why I do what I do. I'm in a position of moral obligation to speak this information to other people in an effort to help to get them to understand it and live it as well. And that is the reason I do this.

(Slide 4) Every person here today who wishes to take real world value, practical value from this seminar here today, I'm going to ask them to make a deliberate and conscious effort to do two things. The first is, try to set aside, to the extent that you capable of doing so, you're perceptions of me as the presenter. This includes things like how you think I look, how I dress, the sound of my voice, my mannerisms, etc. Try to set those things aside to the extent that you are able to do it. I know that is difficult for some and I say this because paying attention to such trivialities will detract your own mental focus away from the information that is being presented today. And that's the worst thing that could happen because it is the information that is important, not me. Try to ignore me and focus on the content.The second thing I ask people to try to do is to be consciously aware, of any of your own impulses that you may have here today to immediately reject the information that is being presented in this seminar based solely upon your own initial emotional reaction, your initial emotional response to this information. This is a logical fallacy: you cannot think with the emotions, so if you hear something you don't like, or that angers you, that's ok. Feel the emotion, but don't just immediately say “that can't be true.” But don't believe me either. It's about checking it. It's about a process of truth discovery. It's about doing your own due diligence and actually researching this material. But if you try to gauge the veracity, meaning the truthfulness of this information solely based upon on how it makes you feel when hearing it, you are committing a logical fallacy. So I ask people to try as much as possible to suspend immediate reactions of disbelief and saying “no, I don't want to accept that, no it can't be true” based on how something may make you feel that you hear today. That's very important to keep in mind.

(Slide 5) And lastly, this information, the entire seminar, is a tapestry. It's like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle. It is meant to be seen and taken as a whole in its entirety. Now I know I'm asking a lot here too because it's going to be a long day. My goal here, my work here is to keep your interest and your attention and your focus throughout the entire course of this seminar, and that's a challenging thing to do. What I'm asking people is, you have to try to see it as a whole because if you took the time to be here and gave a monetary donation to be here, I'm highly recommending that you stay for the whole duration of the seminar. There's a reason for that; you're only going to get the full tapestry, especially if you're new to my work, by hearing this information in its entirety. So if you don't do that, you probably won't recognize the patterns, which is what this is all about. That's what this day is all about, pattern recognition, that are inherent to this tapestry of information and more likely than not, you'll have wasted the time it took for you to be here today and wasted the money you spent to be here today. So I don't want anybody to waste their time and their money and their attention, and I don't think you do either. So that's why I'm asking people, stay for the whole thing; you'll get the maximum value out of this seminar if you stay for its duration. So with that having been said, let's jump into the material.

(Slide 6) This presentation is called Natural Law: The Real Law of Attraction and how to apply it in your life. And I emphasize that term real law of attraction. Many people will be familiar with the new age variants of the so-called law or laws of attraction. This is going to differ quite widely from what people have heard in the new age community and the new age movement regarding what the law or laws of attraction are. These are the real laws of attraction we're going to be hearing today and hopefully understanding today. Let's start in.


# Teachability

## Low Teachability

Low teachability derives from arrogance and rigid skepticism, but also from naiveté and gullibility.

## High Teachability

High teachability derives from a balance between healthy skepticism and an open- minded willingness to learn, and more importantly, the willingness to change.

## Consider Your Sources

People should consider with great care their sources for information. Because by refusing to present certain information, and by influencing people to dismiss certain information as unimportant or unnecessary to consider, many modern institutions (like the mainstream media, or so-called “educational” institutions) seek to control human perceptions, and by doing so, limit what human beings may come to understand. By limiting what a person is able to understand, a person is automatically limited in what they are able to do, what they are able to change, and what they are able to create.

So again, you should not just believe anything you read here.
You need to look into the information written about in this guide for yourself, and most importantly, personal introspection is necessary; to really feel within whether or not this information resonates with truth. Every person has that intuitive capacity to a certain degree.

# Requirements & the Role of Knowledge

## Intro

People everywhere say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as a whole, such as happiness, health, peace, freedom, etc. Which of course, are all great things to aspire to, and most people will say that they want these things. However, it feels as though they aren't being completely honest with themselves, because when they are told that those aren't automatic conditions that manifest themselves, and that there are specific requirements for us to obtain these conditions, they usually don't want to hear about it. Also, people wouldn't say they want these conditions if they were already omnipresent. People say they want something because they don't already have it, whether it be partially, or in full.

## Requirements

This is what the real law of attraction is about; it explains that conditions of which you say you want them, don't automatically manifest by thinking of them, or just having a feeling about them. There are certain requirements for obtaining those conditions.
Of course, this statement only counts if you want something to be different than the way it already is; if you're completely okay with the way things are now, requirement doesn't exist.

## Knowledge

We need to know certain things. Knowledge that will ultimately lead us to positive action is
what's required. Specifically, the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining the conditions
we say we want. However, if this knowledge is absent it obviously can't be obtained and used
to create change. But if it is present, then it must be wilfully being ignored, and as long as this
knowledge continues to remain unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired
conditions will be impossible. And that is exactly what this guide is about; what those
requirements are, and what this knowledge consists of.

# Occult Knowledge

## Hidden Knowledge

This knowledge is "Occulted", meaning it ~~is~~ was "Hidden".

Derived from the Latin adjective &#x2A;**Occultus**&#x2A; which means "concealed, hidden from sight", which is in turn derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Occultare**&#x2A; which means "to keep secret, to conceal." Just like in English, the word &#x2A;**Ocular**&#x2A; means "related to the eye, related to sight", which is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Oculus*** meaning "Eye".

::note
Occult Knowledge is certain information that has been hidden from sight for a specific reason.
::

Occult Knowledge constitutes both the Knowledge of [Human Consciousness]{.font-bold.border-b} and how it operates, and the Knowledge of [Natural Law]{.font-bold.border-b}, the unseen universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of human behavior.

In the ancient mystery traditions and occult schools, these concepts are known as the two 'Arcana' which translates to 'Secret' in both Latin and Greek ('Arcanum (μυστικό)' in Greek)

## Minor Arcana

The Lesser (Minor) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the microcosm - Deals with individual units of consciousness; the human psyche.

## Major Arcana

The Greater (Major) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the macrocosm - Understanding of the
large (universal) laws of Nature that govern the macrocosm - Natural Law.

# Natural Law

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Natural**&#x2A; is derived from the Egyptian word &#x2A;**Neter**&#x2A; (also &#x2A;**Ntr**&#x2A;) which translates to "Spirit, God" and the suffix &#x2A;**-al**&#x2A;, which, just as in English, means: "Related to, of, having come from". Therefore, it can be readily seen that the word &#x2A;**Natural**&#x2A; &#x2A;(Neter + -al)* means "Related to- or, having come from Spirit or God".

## Meaning

Natural Law means the universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of behavior for intelligent species; Beings that are capable of coming to an understanding of their own existence, and their consciousness. And also capable of understanding the objective difference between harmful and non-harmful behavior towards themselves and other beings. This does not include the animal kingdom. For the very same reason you wouldn't attempt to teach mathematics to your cat or dog, this same goes for animals understanding Natural Law. This is because we don't share the same level of consciousness.

## Power Differential

Sadly, within the human population such knowledge also isn't commonly known, because it has been deliberately hidden in order to create and maintain a power differential between those who know that information, and those who are ignorant of it.

## Level the Playing Field

The knowledge of Natural Law and the way it operates constitute some of the most deeply occulted information on Earth, which the powers that be seek to keep hidden from the people, because the understanding of this information would level the playing field and put an end to the currently operating systems of control.

# Nescience vs. Ignorance: the Contexts of Not Knowing

::note
The term nescience is one that has been practically “deleted” from colloquial English.
::

## Nescience

There are two contexts to not knowing something; the first term 'Nescience' is derived from the Latin verb 'Nescire,' which means 'to Not know something because necessary information was absent or unattainable.' The prefix 'Ne-' in Latin means 'Not / Not Present / Absent.' The second part of the word nescience is derived from the Latin verb 'Scio / Sciero' which means 'I know.'

Therefore, in case of nescience it is impossible for a person to aggregate necessary information. Contrary to ignorance, nescience isn't a person's fault; the information simply isn't available for them to perceive.

## Ignorance

The term 'Ignorance' is derived from the Latin verb 'Ignorare' which means 'to Not know something, even though necessary information is present; because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.' This is usually because of disinterest or contradicting beliefs. Ignorance, contrary to nescience, carries blame. Because the person has wilfully chosen to ignore the information.

For the vast majority of people this information is readily available to them, but most people choose to ignore it because they feel they don't need to know it, or because it contradicts something they believe in. Therefore, we live in an ignorant society.

## Your Master Key

What this guide constitutes is a master-key it is accepted (not believed). This process starts by perceiving truth's presence, acknowledging truth's presence, accepting it for what it truly is, and then finally and most importantly, to do something with it.

Understanding this information is not where this work ends; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, action is required.

## Courage to Change

People often say, 'change happens in the heart' or 'change happens in the mind,' which is true, but lastly it happens in the guts. If you have the “guts” to do something, you have developed the courage to do something. We must develop all three, heart, mind and guts; we must care enough to know, and then finally convert that knowledge into action. Because taking action is the most important step towards creating change in the physical realm.

::note
Knowledge --> Understanding --> Action

# Problem Solving

## Overcome Fear

Fear-based denial must first be dealt with and conquered; because denial will only make the problem grow bigger.

## Diagnose Accurately

Recognize that symptoms are merely effects of underlying causes. Instead of treating symptoms, you must make an accurate diagnosis of the cause(s) of the problem. (Diagnosis: from the Greek preposition 'Dia- (δια)' meaning 'Through / By way of,' and the Greek noun 'Gnosis (γνωσις)' which means 'Knowledge.' The term 'Diagnosis' etymologically means 'By way of knowledge') And in doing so, you will come to an understanding of what cause has put certain symptoms into effect.

## Act

Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required action(s) necessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem.

# Truth vs. Perception

For some reason, when people hear the term &#x2A;**Truth*** most tend to immediately jump to incredibly mystified concepts of what truth is (to them); starting to immediately relate the concept to God, or something else that is completely irrelevant. All this is, is mystification and obfuscation of what truth actually is.

Perception is not equal to reality or truth. For example, when a person who is visually impaired removes their glasses. Reality (truth) will remain the same, while the perception of that individual may drastically change.

description: Truth is objective, meaning it is not based on the perceptions of human beings. This alone can be seen as an assault on the human ego; as everybody likes to think their perceptions are important and accurate.

## Perceptions

People's perceptions can differ slightly from the truth, or they can differ wildly from the truth. The truth does not waver, it does not move, bend, or change; it is that which is. It doesn't matter whether anybody believes it, knows it, sees it, nor if anybody wants to see it. It's there, it has always been there, and it will always be there. Nobody can change what has already happened, the past can impossibly be altered. Unlike the future; and the alteration of the future begins in the present moment.

## Truth

All that truth is, is all that has happened in the past, and that which is happening at the present moment. That which is, and that which has been.

Whenever the term &#x2A;**Truth*** is used in this guide, that is all that is being referred to.
In the picture shown here, imagine the white lines which do not waver to be truth, and every coloured line to be the perception of an individual. Their ability to perceive what has occurred, and what is occurring, can be referred to as consciousness (a being's ability to
recognize patterns and meaning inside, and around themselves), which can be either accurate, or inaccurate.

::todo
Add Diagram
::

In case of a low frequency vibration (red line), the wavelength will be longer, and the wave
won't frequently hit the white line. In case of a high frequency vibration (blue line), the wavelength will be a lot shorter, and the wave hits the white line a lot more frequently.
The higher the frequency of a person's consciousness is, the more their wave of perception
hits the unwavering line of truth.

# Solipsism

::note
People who are solipsists, whether they know they are or not, usually have a destructive influence on society.
::

[]{.mb-8.invisible}

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Solipsism**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin adjective &#x2A;**Solus**&#x2A; which means "Alone", or "Only"
and the Latin pronoun &#x2A;**Ipse*** which means "Self", or "Myself" - "Only myself", or "the Self alone".

## Ideology

The ideology of a solipsist is: "Nothing exists outside of me, I am the only being that exists in creation, and everything I perceive is created by me". Or in other words, "I am God". They believe that their perception is the only real perception, and that nobody else outside themselves truly even exists.

What this guide teaches, is that your perception isn't always truth. You have to work to align your perceptions with the truth. Hearing this can already be damaging enough to the ego for some people. But what a solipsist believes is that you don't even exist, and your existence is fully based on his or her perception. Therefore, in their mind, so are your perceptions.

## The Third Sin

Solipsism also happens to be the third sin of Satanism, meaning that Satanists don't want any
solipsism within their own community of followers, but they think it's fine for others to live according to this ideology. The first sin of Satanism happens to be stupidity, which is also something that is looked down upon within their community, but considered fine for others.

## Comfortable Ignorance

In short, solipsism is the ideology that only one's own mind is sure to exist. Solipsists contend that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. Therefore, to them, there is no such thing as objective truth, and nothing about the external world and its workings can actually truly be known.

::note
This state of mind only ensures a person to feel comfortable in their ignorance and laziness.

# Definition of Natural Law

Before we look at the definition of Natural Law, let's look at the definition of the word &#x2A;**Definition*** - "An exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of a word, concept, or object. Also, the degree of clarity of an object, image, or sound; for example, a high definition television."

::note
To define is to make something (de)finite, as opposed to infinite.
::

The more accurate our definitions for words or concepts are, the better our clarity of meaning, and therefore, our understanding of those words or concepts will be. Therefore, 'Definition' means 'Clarity of meaning' when applying it to words and concepts.

Since most of this guide is going to be about Natural Law from here on out, you must know the
definition of the concept:

## Natural

Inherent, or Having a basis in Nature, reality, and truth. Also, not made or caused by humankind.

## Law

An existing condition which is both binding and immutable (cannot be changed).

## Working Definition

description: Universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behavior for all intelligent beings. Natural Law is a set of universal spiritual laws which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness.

## The Science of Natural Law

Natural Law is a testable hypothesis, meaning it is testable by scientific methodology:

- Question →
- Gather information →
- Hypothesis →
- Observe →
- Analyze and test data →
- Draw conclusion →
- Communicate your results.

::note
Natural Law is not a religion or a belief system, but a science.

# Discovery vs. Belief

## Natural Law Vs. Religion

Natural Law is capable of being discovered, understood, and harmonized with; unlike religion, which asks to believe, accept as is, and do without question.

## Belief is Irrelevant

You could best try to understand the way Natural Law works like you understand the law of gravity, and therefore wouldn't walk over the edge of a cliff. The Law of Gravity does not require your belief to be in effect; and neither does Natural Law.

Belief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation of all laws of Nature, such as Gravity, Inertia, Momentum, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism. Similar to such other phenomena of Nature, the workings of Natural Law don't require belief in order to be operational, discovered, and known.

# Consciousness & the Brain

## Definition

***Consciousness*** is the ability of a being to recognize patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place; both within oneself, and in the realm in which the being exists and operates. In other words...

::note
Consciousness is the ability to accurately perceive truth; that which has happened, and that which is happening at the present moment.
::

---

## Expressions of Consciousness

The abilities we have, to make ourselves known to any other being around us. These expressions are:

## Thoughts

Creative (neutral) force. (both Masculine and Feminine).

## Emotions:

Internal expression. (Feminine).

## Actions

Result of thought and emotion being expressed into the physical realm. (Masculine)

Like in almost all major religious traditions, this represents the 'Holy Trinity':
The father creator (thoughts), and the sacred feminine figure (emotions), which the father
figure impregnates or inseminates in some way. From that offspring a male child is born, always. The birth of this male child symbolizes that the 'saviour' of humanity will be action; faith alone will not be enough.

Even in modern Christianity, in their own exoteric scriptures, there is only one prescription
that the Christ-figure gives to the people when asked about freedom (John 8:32) -

::note
You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.

# Brain Structure & Behavior

**The three main complexes that comprise the human brain are:**

1. The R-Complex (Reptilian Brain): Basic survival functions
2. The Limbic system (Mammalian Brain): Human emotion
3. The Neocortex (Human Brain): Higher thought functions and consciousness

## R-Complex

The R-Complex becomes active when we are in 'fight-or-flight' mode; when survival is at stake. This part of the brain also controls basic motor skills and respiration. It is comprised of the brain stem and the cerebellum. It is the lowest conscious part of the brain, meaning it is not a “thinking” part of the brain, merely a part of the brain that reacts to stimulus.

## Limbic system

The Limbic system, also referred to as the 'mid-brain,' makes it possible for us to feel in our physical realm. It does this by releasing neuropeptides into the bloodstream via different glands that comprise the limbic system, for example: the pineal gland, the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland etc. It is the part of our brain which makes all human emotions possible. If this particular part of the brain would not function properly, you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions.

This is partially what psychopathy is; with psychopaths this part of the brain does not function properly. Which could be due to some form of birth disorder, or from chronic conditions in somebody's life which have “numbed” this particular part of the brain.

## Neocortex

The Neocortex is structurally the highest part of the brain, and evolutionary the newest part of the brain. The word 'Neo' derives from the Greek adjective 'Néos (νέος)' which means 'New.' It's where all the electrochemical activity that comprise our 'human modes of thought' take place; that which we consider the things in thought that make us human, and separate us from the animal kingdom. By higher thought functions is meant, for example: logic, intuition, creativity etc. It is essentially the outer layer of the brain's grey matter. As far as evolutionary development of the human brain goes, it is the newest part of our brain structure.

---

## Brain Hemispheres

The brain structure also include two hemispheres which are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning they are able to be divided into approximate mirrored images of each other along the midline. The two separate halves generally control different functions of the brain.

## Left Brain

The left hemisphere is the intellectual part of the brain (masculine): logic, analytical thought, math etc.

## Right Brain

The right hemisphere is the intuitive part of the brain (feminine): creativity, intuition, compassion etc.

::tip
When there is a healthy balance between the two hemispheres of the brain, that's when real consciousness, and pattern recognition is developed. As well as true morality, and ethical consideration.
::

## Intellect ≠ Intelligence

Intellect is not the same as intelligence. Intellect is left brain understanding; while intelligence is holistic understanding, with the right brain included in the process.

The word &#x2A;**Intelligence**&#x2A; is made up of &#x2A;**Intelli**&#x2A; + &#x2A;**Gence**&#x2A;. The "Intelli" part derives from the word "Intellect", and "Gence" comes from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Gignere*** which means "to Generate, to Create, or to Bring forth". So, intellect + creativity, or logic + compassion etc., that is real intelligence; holistic intelligence. Sadly, most people in our society are not holistically intelligent, they are usually in some form of either left- or right brain imbalance.

## Brain Imbalance

If the left brain becomes chronically dominant, the R-Complex will take over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by selfishness and base desires. They usually develop a personality based on domination and control.

If the right brain becomes chronically dominant, the Limbic System takes over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by their own emotions. They usually develop a personality based on submissiveness and naiveté.

# Human Nature

What is the nature of a computer? - To compute information; which is nor good, nor bad.

## Like a Computer

Human nature is to take in information, process it, and output in the form of behavior. Human beings are not computers, however, much like a computer, human beings are programmable.

Similar to a computer, if a human has a bad "file-system format" (conditions during a child's formative ears), a bad “operating system” (culture / environment), and bad “software programs” (erroneous, rigid, and dogmatic beliefs), their “output” (behavior) onto the “screen” (life) will also be bad. Therefore, these people will contribute to deteriorating conditions on a mass scale, for themselves, and all other beings around them.

The behavior of any person will largely depend upon his or her programming; the quality of the information being taken in by them, which enables them to process and create efficiently.

- Garbage in ---> Garbage out
- Quality in ---> Quality out

## Knowledge

(Or lack thereof): Available information - This constitutes potential knowledge that may be generated,
processed, understood, and acted upon by individuals.

## Understanding

(Or lack thereof): Decision-making process - These processes take place in the mind and are chosen by each
individual based upon available information.

## Wisdom

(Or lack thereof): Human behavior - Each individual's behavior is based upon the quality of their decision-
making processes. Which are based upon the quality of their available information.

::note
Wisdom is not the same as knowledge or understanding.
::

Wisdom is either action, or inaction, always. It is knowledge and understanding which has
been applied. For example, knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit
salad.

## Generated Result

(Order or chaos): Manifested reality - The quality of the condition which manifests in any society is based upon the aggregate quality of human behavior within that society.

# Principles of Natural Law

## The Principles

### Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Principle**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Principia*** which means "First, Foremost, Leading, or Most necessary". In other words, that which is most important.

**These are the eight principles of Natural Law:**

**All is mind; the universe is mental.** Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create, by being responsible for everything you think.

**As above so below.** That which is above is like to that which is below, that which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of one another. The universe is self-similar across all scales.

**Nothing rests, everything moves.** At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no 'solidity' as such; the universe is 'holographic.' Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration.

**Everything is dual, everything has poles.** Everything has its opposite. Opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled.

**Cause and effect.** Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law. Chance is but a name for law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why Natural Law is also sometimes referred to as Consequentialism.

**Care, not compassion.** Whatever you give attention to, and help to grow. This does not mean you shouldn't care for any negative things happening in the world because you think that will feed into it and give power to it; if that happens only ignorance is being fed into it. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it will occur. The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality.

::note
What we care about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions.
::

What we as conscious beings need to develop are heart, mind, and guts, in that order. We must care enough to know, and then act accordingly to that understood knowledge. All three must be in place to gain unity consciousness; unifying thoughts, emotions, and actions. Therefore, care can be seen as the ultimate generator of the quality of our experience of life.

Hence the 8th principle is also known as the generative principle. True care is created in our hearts, the 'pump' that causes our blood to flow through our body, in many ancient traditions they spoke of the 'life force' being in the blood. As important as the brain is, the heart is ultimately generating the experience. Because what we care about becomes what we think about, and therefore, how we behave.

That which we care enough about to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created in our world. The reason the world is in the state it's in, is because most people do not care enough (even if they say they want things to be different) to change it through their behavior.

## The Lost Principle

The principle of Care is also referred to as the Lost Principle. This principle encapsulates all seven other principles; if you look at the seven circles that form the seed of life, the 8th added circle forms the outer shell. Without this shell present and intact, the creative (generative) essence of the seed will be lost.

# The Two Spiritual Currencies

Whatever information or endeavors we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting
something in return for that investment. This return could come in the form of knowledge,
understanding, skills, or expertise. However, this only happens if we invest our spiritual
currencies wisely. We should seek to improve the quality of our attention by directing it
towards information that is capable of improving both our own lives, as well as the human
condition as a whole.

Such an effort would constitute a valuable investment of our time. We should more frequently ask ourselves the questions:

**“What am I spending my time on?**

**What am I paying attention to?”**

And most importantly,

**“What kind of quality am I getting in return for these investments of my spiritual currencies?"**

# Natural Law Expressions

## 1. Love / Fear

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Generative Polarity is &#x2A;**Love***. In regard to Natural Law,
love should be seen as the expansive force for consciousness. Love is the force which helps us become open to truth, and expand our awareness.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the generative polarity is &#x2A;**Fear***. In regard to Natural Law, fear should be seen as the contractive force for consciousness. Fear is the force which influences us to become closed to truth, and the force which ultimately shuts down our awareness.

---

## 2. Knowledge / Ignorance

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Initiating Expression is &#x2A;**Knowledge***,or the acceptance of truth. Knowledge of truth positively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the initiating expression is &#x2A;**Ignorance***, or the refusal of truth. Ignorance negatively influences the quality of our lives because it negatively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.

::note
It is important to remember that "Ignorance" should be distinguished from "Nescience". Nescience means not knowing something because necessary information is not present, or unattainable. Ignorance, on the other hand, means not knowing something even though necessary information is present, because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.
::

“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what
never was and never will be.” - Thomas Jefferson, 3rd president of the U.S.A.

“The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance.”

- Socrates, Greek philosopher

---

## 3. Sovereignty / Confusion

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Internal Expression is &#x2A;**Sovereignty***, or what is also referred to as **Internal Monarchy** (one ruler within).

The word "Monarchy" is made up of the prefix &#x2A;**Mon-**&#x2A; derived from the Greek adverb &#x2A;**Mons**&#x2A; (μόνα) which means "One, Single, or Alone" and the Greek noun &#x2A;**Archon*** (αρχων) which means "Master, Lord, or Ruler". Therefore, Monarchy means "One Ruler".

::note
As a state of consciousness, sovereignty means that one has unified the three aspects of their consciousness, in the way that there is no contradiction between one's thoughts, emotions, and actions.
::

The word "Sovereign" is derived from the Latin adverb &#x2A;**Super**&#x2A; which means "Above, or Beyond" (In classical Latin the &#x2A;**V**&#x2A; character represented a &#x2A;**U**&#x2A;, hence the letter "W" is called a "double U". The "V-sound" didn't phonetically exist in classical Latin, instead the "V" was represented by the letters "P" or "B"). The second half stems from the word &#x2A;**Regnum**&#x2A; which means "Reign, Rulership, or (externally imposed) Control, or Kingship". Thus, the word "Sovereign" means: "One who is above the rulership or control of another". Therefore, the word sovereign means "not a slave". Being sovereign means being a monarch (&#x2A;**Mon-**&#x2A;: "One", &#x2A;**Archon***: "Ruler"), a single ruler who rules only the "kingdom of self". Sovereignty is a state of being in which one controls one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions, and by bringing them into Unity, Non-Contradiction, Non-Duality, attains mastery of one's own consciousness. Self-Control is Self-Mastery is Self-Ownership.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the internal expression is &#x2A;**Confusion***, or what is also referred to as **Internal Anarchy** (no ruler within). Confusion is the state of mind in which the being is ruled by fear and ignorance. Confusion can be seen as internal opposition, in such a way that one's thoughts, emotions, and actions are in perpetual contradiction with one another; the three are not in alignment. As we think is not how we truly feel, and is not how we act. There is complete contradiction and separation internally, when there is no unity amongst these three aspects of our consciousness.

---

## 4. Freedom / Control

**Positive:**:br
The positive aspect of the External Expression is 'Freedom,' or what is also
referred to as 'External Anarchy' (no external ruler). True freedom for all beings
should be seen as the ultimate goal of spiritual development. And such a state can only
manifest as a result of human society's adherence to Natural Law.

**Negative:**:br
The negative aspect of the external expression is 'Control,' or what is referred to as
External Monarchy (one external ruler). For example, the concentration of illusory
power by a king, or by institutions like government.
Externally imposed control is the pathway to all forms of evil and destruction. It
results when a society lives in direct opposition to Natural Law.

---

## 5. Order / Chaos

**Positive:**:br
The positive Manifestation is 'Order,' or manifested good. Order represents
everything we truly want to manifest. Order results only when there is balance and
justice; which can only be present when truth has been accepted, and our behavior
has been brought into harmony with Natural Law.

**Negative:**:br
The negative manifestation is 'Chaos,' or manifested evil. Chaos is the exact
opposite of what we truly want to manifest. Chaos occurs when there is imbalance and
injustice, which results whenever there is ignorance of truth, and behavior which is in
opposition to Natural Law.

---

description: All five expressions of Natural Law are unilateral, meaning they do not cross over into one another.

Therefore, there is no way you could accept truth and develop knowledge, and then end up in a state of confusion. Just as you cannot go from ignorance to sovereignty. The Natural Law expressions simply don't work that way.

::note
If you keep waiting on an external saviour, you are going to be waiting in your chains forever.
::

Even the modern Christ-figure himself proclaimed that the knowledge of truth would be the only pathway to true freedom. Until you take in the light, you will never dispel the darkness. The light being knowledge of truth; which is what 'light' has always symbolized and represented in the bible, and in numerous other ancient mystery traditions. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.” - John 1:5

# Right vs. Wrong

This can be explained in a way that's completely unambiguous; if you believe that there is no real difference between right and wrong, and that this concept isn't inherent in Nature, you are accepting a Satanic belief. This is because the second tenet of Satanism is the concept of "Moral Relativism" (left brain imbalance).

::todo
Insert chart
::

## The Pillars of Satanism

There are four main tenets for the ideology of Satanism, also referred to as the "Pillars of Satanism":

## 1. Self Preservation

Is the highest aspiration: If they must step on others to save themselves, they will have no problem doing so.

## 2. Moral relativism

To Satanists there is no such thing as the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. They consider 'right' to be what is 'good for me'
and 'wrong' what is 'bad for me.' And that they themselves can make up the difference between the two, based on their own personal likes and preferences.

## 3. Social Darwinism

A ruling class delegates itself the right to control and direct the masses, because they believe they know better than the rest of humanity.

## 4. Eugenics

A social ideology advocating the promotion of higher rates of sexual reproduction for people with traits and characteristics desired by its proponents - in this case Satanists - and reduced rates of sexual reproduction, or even sterilization for those with undesired traits and characteristics. The word is derived from the Greek adjective 'Eugenes (εύγενής)' which means 'Well-born / of Good stock / of Noble race.' Which is in turn derived from the Greek adjective 'Eu- (εὖ-)' which means 'Good / Well,' and the Greek noun 'Genos (γένος)' meaning 'Birth / Race / Stock.'

---

::note
Morality is not about right versus left, it's about right versus wrong.
::

::tip
A deep understanding of morality, and the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of Natural Law.
::

Just as in ancient Rome the word &#x2A;**Liber**&#x2A; meant "Book" (Library), and "Free" (Liberty) simultaneously. The word &#x2A;**Right**&#x2A; means "Correct" and "Moral" simultaneously, as does &#x2A;**Wrong*** mean "Incorrect" and "Immoral" simultaneously.

## What a Right Is

So, in the sense of what you "have a right to do", what is a right?

A right is any action in which you are correct and moral in doing so. Every single person has the same rights as the next; not one person has any more rights than another, nor any less rights, at any place, at any time.

# Knowing Rights

This process helps us to understand what a right actually is, by understanding which actions are not rights because they cause harm to other sentient beings.

The word &#x2A;**Apophasis**&#x2A; is derived from the Greek noun &#x2A;**Apophanai*** (απόφασις) which means "to Speak off". This is a method of logical, deductive reasoning, that is employed when given a limited set of possibilities, in which we gain knowledge about something by excluding the known negatives, or by setting the logical inconsistencies to the side.

In other words, describing what something is, by explaining what it is not.

# Natural Law Transgressions

## Murder & Assault

Ending a life without the right to do so. If a being is killed in the act of somebody defending themselves, it is not murder.
Under no possible circumstance does the “right to murder” or the “right to assault” exist. However, the right to defend oneself through physical force exists at all times.

## Rape

Coercing the free will of another person, and making them sexually associate with whom they wish not to.

## Theft

Taking what somebody else has created or acquired through lawful means, which is their property for as long as they are using it and being responsible for it. You have no right to just take something that does not belong to you.

## Trespass

Every person has the right to set aside a (reasonably sized) space for themselves. And invading this area without permission or consent would be invading their privacy and their personal space, while taking away their security in the process.

## Coercion

Forcing somebody through threat of violence to have their will comply with yours, whether they wish that to be the case or not. Making somebody do something against their will is not a right. Although this is already a short and seemingly simple list, all these transgressions can ultimately be narrowed down to just one wrong-doing: Theft.

::note
Every harmful action that a person is capable of taking is a form of theft. Some form of property is always being stolen when a wrong-doing is committed.
::

---

## Property Types

- Life is a form of property.
- Rights are a form of property.
- Freedom is a form of property.
- A person's own body is a form of property.

## No Victim, No Crime

A living being or their property must have been harmed or damaged in order for a violation of Natural Law, or a wrong-doing to have taken place. Any action which does not cause such harm to other sentient beings is a right. - No victim, no crime. This is the fundamental crux of Natural Law; what is right behavior, and what is wrong behavior.

## No Delegation

There is no such thing as the delegation of a wrong-doing. In other words, if a specific action is not a right for any individual, then that action cannot be "delegated", "granted", or "licensed" to any other individual, or group of individuals, and suddenly be called a right. That action forever remains wrong under Natural Law.

::tip
Rights can't be granted to human beings by other human beings, because rights don't come from human beings.
::

## Equal Rights

Everybody is born with the exact same rights. Natural Law (the difference between right and wrong behavior) always holds true regardless of a population's belief systems (culture). This means that it doesn't matter how many people agree that a wrong action can be turned into a right action, or that a right action can be turned into a wrong action.

Such things can never be done in reality. People can only believe they can claim such reversals and that this will in some way make it so. Unfortunately, at this moment in time most people do erroneously believe that it is morally possible for some groups of people to create and delegate "rights" which do not exist, or to take away rights which do exist.

## A World with Only Two People

When in doubt as to whether an action is, or is not in harmony with Natural Law, visualize the scenario of a world with only two people.

If the behavior is a right or a wrong in that instance, it shall forever remain a right or a wrong in any size population, regardless of how many people may believe otherwise. So, if the action is a right for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a right. And if the action is a wrong for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a wrong, regardless of the number of people involved.

# Taxation, Prohibition, Licenses & Permits

## What Taxation Really Is

Taxation is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given or delegated the "right" to (forcibly) confiscate an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual's labour (a form of property), whether or not that person agrees to share that product voluntarily (coercion is involved).

## Enforced by Threats

Taxation is enforced by the following threats:

1. **Theft** - Seizing property that is rightfully a person's possession.
2. **Imprisonment** - Taking away the physical freedom of movement.
3. **Violence** - Behavior resulting in bodily harm, if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist the confiscation.

::note
These practices is always "justified" by those who claim that such practices are necessary and required to uphold the common good.
::

## Justification

The word "Justified" etymologically derives from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Jus**&#x2A; or &#x2A;**Juris**&#x2A; which mean "Right, Law", and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Facere*** which means "to Create, or to Make". Therefore, "to Justify" etymologically means "to Create right, to Create law."

## Involuntary Confiscation

If we define the concept of slavery as: the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of labour of another person, we can clearly see that there is no percentage to which we could lower this number (other than 0%) that would no longer constitute slavery. Many people try to justify this by saying this money is used for different services. However, we aren't able to refuse most of these "services".

Imagine, you have a computer at home; one day a computer technician knocks on your door and tells you: "I am now your computer technician, and you are not allowed to refuse my services." Immediately the right to choose (free will) has been taken away from you. Then he tells you "Whether you want or don't want my technician services, I'm going to need $300, every year, and I'll come over every two months to collect my money. I do not care if you are happy with my service or not, and if you refuse to pay me, I will take your computer."

## Duress

Does it seem like the computer is truly yours, if you are living under that kind of coercion? Or does it seem more like a violent criminal telling you: "I am going to steal your possessions if you don't give me what I tell you to." That sounds more like a form of extortion or duress, and that is what all forms of taxation fall under.

## Taxation Is Slavery

If we are being completely honest with ourselves, taxation is merely a euphemism for theft, violence, and slavery; these are the three practices on which it is actually truly based. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim ownership of the product of another person's labour, such behavior can never be delegated to a group of people, and called a "right." Therefore:

::note
All forms of taxation are always wrong according to Natural Law.
::

## Prohibition

Another important example of something to examine for what it actually truly is, is Prohibition. Whether regarding drugs or junk-food, ingesting anything harmful into the body is strongly opposed, hopefully for obvious reasons; purification of the body is an important part of purification of the mind.

description: It is crucial to recognize that anyone should be allowed to put anything inside their body, because they own their body.

If an individual, for whatever reason, wants to ingest any given substance they always have the right to do so; because their body is their property. People easily tend to overthink the concept when confronted with the question whether their body is theirs or not. They often pause and ask themselves questions like: "Am I going to own my body forever? I'm going to die someday, does that mean I don't own it now?" This is a complete over-mystification of the concept.

All sensible people recognize that they will die someday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies. Does that mean they don't own their body right now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives, exists inside) your body, which is one of the specific reasons you own your body, the other is that you are using your body right now. Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using it as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness. Your body is yours.

Continuing on the topic of Prohibition, it is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent others from putting any given substance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they will be fined or imprisoned. It should be self-evident that since an individual's body is their own property, that individual always maintains the natural right to decide what will or will not be put into their own property. In this instance, their own body.

Imagine another person telling you that you aren't allowed to put your jacket into your car, or that you can't put a certain piece of furniture inside your home. Why is it that most people would not accept that, but do accept this concept regarding their own body? - Because people can't seem to separate the act of imbibing the substance, and the action that someone may subsequently take, which are two different things.

A person may have some drinks, and get drunk if they wish to; but if that person goes out on the street afterwards and starts beating somebody up for no reason, they obviously have no right to do that. However, an individual
maintains the right to go drinking, or use cocaine, or even inject heroine into their arm. They obviously aren't good ideas, but every individual has the right to do so if they please; as long as their subsequent behavior isn't immoral and wrong. And if it is, they are still fully accountable for the actions they took, that's what personal responsibility is.

The two separate acts of a person having the right to put whatever they want into their own body, and still being personally responsible for whatever he or she may do with their body afterwards, need to be clearly delineated, and separated from one another.

description: Understanding this, we can easily see that the claim of "right" to dictate what will or will not be put into the body of another person amounts to a claim of ownership upon the other person's body.

Imagine somebody telling you that you aren't allowed to eat carrots or drink orange juice for example. The claim of ownership upon another person's body is slavery. Therefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery, backed by violence, regardless of the justifications made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's body, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

::tip
All forms of prohibition are always wrong according to Natural Law.
::

## Licenses & Permits

Lastly, we will examine Licenses and Permits, keep in mind to also visualize the same scenario with only two people as was mentioned before. In that sense, most people can readily see that no single person, or group of people is able to legitimately make these claims towards another person; regarding taxation, prohibition, licenses and permits.

We have gotten to the point where most people actually believe that certain groups of people have created rights for themselves that other people don't have. Licenses and permits are claims that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent other people from exercising specific behaviors, even if such behaviors cause no harm to others, or their property.

Unless those people [petition](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#petition), or pay the government for permission (where the word "permit" is derived from) to be allowed to exercise those behaviors. This amounts to the claim that rights are merely privileges that may be granted or taken away by government at any time, based upon the people in government's preference or discretion.

Remembering that the definition of a [right](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#right) is: "any action which does not cause harm to another sentient being or their property". It can be readily seen that there is no such thing as the "right" to stop someone from exercising a right, since rights cause no harm.

The claim over the rights of another person is called slavery, regardless of the justification made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's rights, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

::tip
All forms of licensing and permits are always wrong according to Natural Law

# Force vs. Violence

## Force

**The capacity to do work or cause physical change.** For any change to be created in the physical world in any capacity, physical force must be applied. There is nothing you can do to change something in the physical world, that doesn't require force. The words you are reading right now were typed out by hand using physical force.

::tip
Force is the capacity to perform physical work, physical change.
::

**Action which is in harmony with morality and Natural Law because it does not violate others' rights.** As soon as a person steps over that line, and uses initiation of force for coercive reasons or applications, that is what makes it violence instead of force. Force itself is not the same as violence.

**Action which one always possesses the right to take (including defense against violence).** When you are approached with violence you reserve the right to use physical force defensively against such an assault.

## Violence

**The immoral initiation of physical power to coerce, compel or restrain.** [Initiation](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#initiation) is the key-word here. Nobody ever has the right to enact violence; because violence is always starting the conflict.

::note
The immoral initiation of force is violence.
::

For example, what often happens in primary schools when two students get into a physical altercation, the teachers usually tend to say: "It doesn't matter who started it". While that is one of the absolute most critically important things that matters. Because the person that struck first, is the person that conducted violence, they initiated the immoral use of physical force.

**Coercive action which is in opposition to morality and Natural Law because it involves the violation of others' rights.*&#x2A; This is exactly why it's called violence; it violates the rights of other people. The act of violating rights is what violence is, it's derived from the same root word, the Latin verb &#x2A;**Violare***, which means "to Treat with violence or dishonor".

**Action which one never possesses the right to take.** There exists no such thing as the right to commit violence. However, one always reserves the right to use force in a defensive capacity, up to, and including deadly force.

# The Two Pillars of Enlightenment

## The Sacred Feminine

The first pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Feminine principle", also called the **Non-Aggression Principle**. This principle states:

::tip
Do not engage in violence. In other words, do not immorally initiate non-rightful use of physical force to coerce, constrain, or compel the rightful behavior, or free will choice of another sentient being.
::

## The Sacred Masculine

The second pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Masculine principle", also called the **Self-Defense Principle**. This principle states:

Sentient beings have the inherent right to use force to defend themselves and others from violence conducted against them.

2. Control of usage
3. Maintaining personal responsibility.

# Conscience

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Conscience**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin prefix &#x2A;**Con-**&#x2A; which means "Together, or with" and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Scire*** which means "to Know, or to Understand". Those two words combined mean "to Know together". Therefore:

::tip
Conscience is common sense, quite literally. All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong behavior according to Natural Law.
::

## Exercise of Conscience (Action)

The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong according to Natural Law has been acquired and integrated into the being. We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act either in accordance with it, or in disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, that is called the exercise of conscience.

# The Law of Freedom

::tip
As morality increases, freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.
::

## Inverse Proportions

Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of people in any given society, is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and morality there is, the less tyranny and slavery there will be within that society.

## True Freedom

True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces Moral Relativism, the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, thinking that humanity may arbitrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.

# Natural Law vs. Mans Law

## Natural Law

**Based upon principles & truth**. :br
Inherent to creation. Things that are inherent to creation are not made or caused by humankind.

**Harmonized with, due to knowledge & understanding. (or rejected, due to ignorance or contradicting beliefs).**:br
Natural Law isn't something that's based on a person's compliance, because that person has to fear the “punishment” of not understanding it. If you don't understand it, and don't live according to it, the result or consequence will be inescapable.

::tip
If you behave a certain way, there are certain consequences. And if you change your
behavior, you'll change the consequential results.
::

### Universal

Exists and applies anywhere in the universe regardless of location. There is no place you can go in the physical universe where Natural Law doesn't apply.

### Eternal and immutable.

Exists and applies for as long as the universe exists, and cannot be changed. Natural Law is immutable because it cannot be changed by any action that any being in the universe is capable of taking.

---

## Man's Law (Government)

### Dogmatic

Based upon dogmatic beliefs. (Constructs of mind). These beliefs can be seen as “programs” operating in the human mind.

### Fear Based

Complied with due to fear of punishment. Fear is usually the only reason people ever comply with the law of man; and fear is an extremely low state of consciousness.

### Location Based Moral Relativism

Differs with location based upon the whim of legislators. For example, prohibition; you are "allowed" to smoke marijuana in certain countries, but could be jailed for doing the exact same thing in another country where it's deemed "illegal".

### Time Based Moral Relativism

Changes with time based upon the whim of legislators. To use prohibition as an example again; from 1920 until 1933, it was made illegal to possess, and to consume alcohol in the United States of America. Before 1920 it was legal, and after 1933 it was made legal again, all because of what some politicians wrote on pieces of paper.

For man's law this means; if a particular man-made law is in harmony with Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is redundant, since it is stating a truth that is pre-existing and inherent in Nature. Therefore, the writing down of that concept and calling it a law, is both unnecessary and irrelevant.

If a particular man-made law is in opposition to Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is both false (incorrect) and immoral (harmful to others), more simply put, it's wrong. Because if it isn't based in Natural Law it means that it is causing somebody harm by taking something that belongs to them, whether it's a right, or any physical possession. Therefore, it can never be legitimately binding upon anyone. Somebody can't write down a wrong-doing and tell you that it is morally binding upon you, while simultaneously literally stating that even though it causes harm, you must obey this rule.

::tip
In light and presence of Natural Law, man's “law” is always unnecessary and irrelevant.

# Equality Under Natural Law

## Not Granted or Gifted

Since rights are not created by humanity, and since they are the birth-right of humanity, gifted to us by the Creator of the universe. Not a single person or group of people is capable of "granting" or "gifting" rights to anyone else, nor is any person capable of revoking rights from anyone else. Including Governments.

## What Government Really Is

The word &#x2A;**Government**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Gubernare**&#x2A; which means "to Control, to Rule, or to Direct". (just as was shown earlier with the etymological breakdown of the word "Sovereign", there is no "V sound" in classical Latin. This can be readily seen in the name of the ceremony for electing a governor; they are called &#x2A;**Gubernatorial**&#x2A; elections.) The second part of the word "Government" is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Mens**&#x2A; which means &#x2A;**Mind***. Therefore, put together the word "Govern-ment" etymologically means "Mind Control".

::note
Government is Mind Control
::

The etymological origin of the English suffix &#x2A;**-ment**&#x2A; is often debated, yet it is quite clear that those who created the English language deliberately chose &#x2A;**Mens**&#x2A; the Latin word for &#x2A;**Mind***, to mean "the State of-" or "the Condition of-", in direct keeping with the first Hermetic principle, the principle of Mentalism. Which demonstrates that in order for any particular event, circumstance, state or condition to exist in our current manifested reality (the plane of effects), it must first have existed in the mind (the plane of causality).

## The Illusion of Authority

Government is based on the illusory concept called "Authority". People that believe certain other people are authorities, means they believe that those individuals have rights that other people do not. Mainly, the rights to command, compel, coerce and constrain.

Authority is based upon an equally illusory concept called "Jurisdiction". The word
&#x2A;**Jurisdiction**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Jus**&#x2A; or &#x2A;**Juris**&#x2A; which means "Right, or Law", and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Dictere*** which means "to Speak, or to Say". Thus, the word "Jurisdiction" literally means "to Say what the law is". In other words, to "make up" or to "decide" what the law is.

"Authority" is an illusion of a diseased psyche, based entirely in violence and built upon the false belief that some people are "masters" who have the moral right to issue commands, and that other people have a moral obligation to obey those commands. Simply put, slavery.

::note
The belief in the legitimacy of "Authority" is the belief in the legitimacy of Slavery.
::

description: Ultimately, "Authority" is the idea that man can become God, and through jurisdiction, dictate the law, and dictate what is right and wrong.

The concept of government and the concept of authority are forms of (false) religion, yet most people fail to see it that way. The word &#x2A;**Religion**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Religare*** which means "to Tie back, to Hold back, to Thwart from forward progress, or to Bind.'

A false religion is a system of control based in unchallenged, dogmatic belief which holds back the progress of consciousness.

::tip
We should stop trying to make our religion truth, and start making truth our religion.
::

## The One True Divide

There is only one true divide that separates humanity into two distinct types of individuals. The criterion for this divide is whether or not a person believes in “authority,” and therefore believes that there is legitimacy to slavery. That is the only divide which truly separates us.

# Statism vs. Anarchy

## Statism

A Statist is a person who erroneously believes that there is such a thing as “authority” vested in certain people, giving them the “right” to rule over others. This “authority” means that certain people, who call themselves 'government,' have the moral right to issue commands to those whom they rule (those under their jurisdiction), and that their subjects (slaves) have a “moral obligation” to obey the arbitrary dictates (laws) set by their “masters.”

::note
Most simply put, a statist is someone who believes in the legitimacy of slavery.
::

## Anarchy

Conversely, an Anarchist is a person that knows there could never be legitimacy to “authority” or “government” because those terms are simply euphemisms for violence and slavery, which are always immoral and in opposition to Natural Law.

The word &#x2A;**Anarchy**&#x2A; is derived from the Greek prefix &#x2A;**An-**&#x2A; (αν-) which means "Without, or the Absence of" and the Greek noun &#x2A;**Archon*** (αρχων)' which means "Master, or Ruler". Anarchy does not mean "Without rules". It literally means "Without Rulers, or Without Masters".

The only permanent rules that are in place, are the ones of Natural Law.

::note
No Masters = No Slaves
::

It seems self-evident that &#x2A;**Anarchy*** is the true meaning of freedom, and yet, when you ask a person what anarchy means (to them), and what they associate it with, the answer will most likely be: rioting, looting and destroying other people's property, in one word; chaos. Which is literally the exact opposite of what anarchy truly is.

# The Fear of Chaos

  :::
::

## Do Not Burn Yourself

What you see pictured above is obviously a bad idea and you probably shouldn't do that; if your desire is not to burn your hand up to the point of blistering and your skin coming off. But if you don't care about that happening, then by all means, keep your hand right on that burner. However, if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining that condition. That means you can't keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or Natural Law will take over and burn your hand.

In our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be burned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is switched on, and NOT be burned!” But obviously, it doesn't work that way.

If you don't want to be burned, your hand can't be kept there while the stove is on; if you don't want self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you've got to align your behavior to Natural Law. Which means you've got to know the objective difference between right and wrong behavior, and through free will choice deliberately choose right action over wrong action. And only then, will you not get burnt.

::tip
True freedom includes infinite possibility, which, by definition, includes the possibility of chaos. This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free.
::

## The Fear of True Freedom

For real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there could be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpected happening, something going wrong, or someone getting hurt; but if you are living in that state of fear, you are living in a very low state of consciousness.

Fear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because it is based in fear (see 'Natural Law expressions' chart). The fear of the possibility of chaos is the fear of true freedom. This can also symbolically be seen as the “death” of the imagination.

## Imagination

Imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. This is because, according to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world (plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of causality).

::caution
If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible.
::

Through their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), most people advocate the
legitimacy and continuance of “authority” and government, and are therefore actually
advocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery.

Those who believe that “authority” is necessary and that it must continue, have been duped into believing that human slavery is necessary and must continue in order to prevent chaos.

::tip
Violence and slavery cannot prevent chaos. Violence and slavery are chaos.

# Order Followers

Not the ruling class, not the political "leader", or "masters", and not the so-called "elite", The people that keep the current slavery system in place, are the people who wilfully follow orders. Which can be a difficult truth to learn, and to accept for a lot of people.

## Following Orders

Following orders means doing what you are told to do, without judging for yourself whether or not the action you are being ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

If an individual is following orders, that individual can impossibly be exercising conscience, because by definition, exercising conscience means that one is wilfully choosing for themselves right action over wrong action.

Following orders should never be seen as a virtue of any kind; if you are acting based solely on what someone has told you to do, there is no morality found in that, whatsoever. There is no such thing as morally following orders, the two terms are contradictory.

Therefore, "I was just following order", is never a valid excuse or justification for immoral, harmful behavior. This sorry attempt to give up personal responsibility should never be accepted as a valid excuse for such behavior.

## Unconscious Behavior

The order-follower tries to abdicate their personal responsibility for their actions and pretend the blame lies with the order giver; which is an obvious lie (to themselves, mainly). They could look you dead in the eye and say "I'm not responsible for that. I just did it; but I'm not the person who's responsible for it, because I was acting on orders from somebody else",

It's astonishing that they somehow truly seem to believe that statement can be regarded as true, in any way. Sadly, lots of people nowadays believe that there is legitimacy to this immoral behavior because a group of people calling themselves 'government' have somehow been imbued and gifted with such "rights",

The people in government believe they have rights that others don't; but what's even worse is that the people who are actually affected by their immoral behavior, they believe it too.

# Moral Culpability

## Definition

Moral culpability is the determination of who is ultimately at fault, or deserving of blame for
the commission of actions which resulted in harm or loss for others.

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Culpable**&#x2A; means "at Fault, or Deserving of blame", it is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Culpa*** which means "Fault, or Blame".

::note
The people that act out a certain behavior and cause harm, loss, chaos or trauma to others
always carry blame.
::

**Who actually carried out the holocaust in Germany?**:br
The people that followed the orders to do so; therefore, order-followers is the answer. And they are always in the form of police or military; this is why a totalitarian state is referred to as a "Police State." Because they are the people ultimately responsible for bringing that condition into manifestation through their behavior.

## Police State

The order giver (president, mayor, judge etc.) makes a command, the order-follower obeys without question, and through their behavior make that condition a reality; that"s why it"s called a police state. Because every police state that has ever existed, has
always been created by police following orders. Because they don't want to think for themselves, they don't want the personal responsibility and they don't want to truly know the difference between right and wrong for themselves, like a responsible adult person would.

::todo
Insert Figure
::

Note that the term "MORE" is underlined and capitalized; the order givers are also morally culpable, that is not the question. The question is “Who is MORE morally culpable?” The answer is always the order-follower, at any time, in any place.

The people on the left aren't the actual cause of what happened on the picture in the middle; all they did was sign some pieces of paper, and told the people on the right: “Go and bomb/shoot/kill these people” and they said “Yes, sir” and went right ahead and committed whatever wrong-doings they were commanded, without questioning at all if what they had been ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

::todo
Insert Figure
::

The order-follower always bears more moral culpability that the order-giver, because the order-follower is the one who actually performed the action, and in taking such action, brought the resulting harm into physical manifestation. Order-following is the pathway to every form of evil and chaos in our world. Again, it should never be seen as a virtue by anyone who considers themselves a moral person. Order-followers have ultimately been personally responsible and morally culpable for every form of slavery and every single totalitarian regime that has ever existed.

# Responsibility vs. Abdication

## Responsibility

An individual's personal responsibility to choose right action over wrong action for themselves is always their own. One can only (falsely) claim that they are abdicating personal responsibility for such choice to someone else, it can never actually be done in reality. It's merely a claim when an order-follower says, “I am not personally responsible, because this person told me to do it” and what it actually truly is, is just a lie. More simply put...

::note
Every individual is 

**always responsible**

 for their own actions
::

> “Accept responsibility for yourself and your actions, thoughts, and words. You alone make choices. You alone are answerable to the consequences of your behavior. The feeble excuse that your boss required it, or the establishment expected it, holds no truth or justification.” :br*David Icke, English Author*

Lots of people erroneously believe that they can hand over their Natural Law right to defend themselves to another individual, or entity. In making such a false claim, they have attempted to abdicate a responsibility which always belongs to them, and can't be wholly given away.

# Self Loathing vs. Self Respect

::note
The states of Self Loathing and Self Respect cannot exist simultaneously, for they are contradictory psychological conditions.
::

## Self Loathing

Self-loathing is the underlying psychological condition that causes people to attempt to abdicate their own personal responsibility to exercise conscience, and fall into patterns of order-following and justification. Just as it is not possible for an order-follower to truly be exercising conscience; it is also not possible for an order-follower to truly love themselves.

Self-loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been buried into the subconscious mind, instead of being confronted, dealt with, and healed. Such trauma could form feelings of inadequacy; whether they are real, suggested, or simply imagined. A mind-set as such is a psychological prison, and yet, people suffering from self-loathing
usually don't seem to have any desire for true freedom - &#x2A;*They are in the cage, and they love being in the cage.**

::tip
The only kind of people that have no desire for real freedom, are people in the psychological state of self-loathing, that do not love themselves.
::

## Self Respect

Self-respect heals self-loathing. It is about introspection (observation or examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotional state).

The word &#x2A;**Respect**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin prefix &#x2A;**Re-**&#x2A; which means "Again" and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Spectare*** which means "to Look at, or to Take another look at oneself". This is where true respect starts.

You cannot give somebody something that you don't already own yourself. If you don't have $10,- in your pocket you could impossibly give it to someone else. You must obtain it first, before you can give it away. Therefore, nobody can give respect to anybody else unless they first developed it inwardly.

Self-respect must come first, which is why people in the state of self-loathing don't respect anybody, least of all themselves. Only self-respect can heal self-loathing, and therefore help put an order-follower on the path to exercising conscience.

# The Lost Word

## Balanced Consciousness

In order to speak the lost word, a person must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium (balance) between the left and right brain hemispheres.

In such a state of balanced consciousness, the individual has come to know the self (microcosm), as well as the working operations of Natural Law (macrocosm), and in doing so has come to understand the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. Or as they are referred to in Freemasonry, "**Light** (Knowledge)" and "**Darkness** (Ignorance)".

## The Word of All Power

In the balanced state of consciousness generated through the knowledge of Natural Law, a person is finally able to speak the lost word, which is - "**No**".

In Freemasonry it is considered to be the word of all power. When we say no to those who claim to be our owners, those who claim that they will decide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our
rights (all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the **knowledge, care, and courage** that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be "lost".

## Know your Rights

The reason you have to know what the difference between right and wrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have, is because those who don't know, won't say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner).

# Teaching Natural Law to Others

::tip
Knowledge is the only solution; and the propagation of that knowledge is Education.
::

## Education

The word &#x2A;**Education**&#x2A; derives from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Educere*** means "to Take, to Draw, or to Lead out from". Leading a person out of darkness (ignorance) is what a real teacher does.

Rather than “pushing” a person out of that darkness, the teacher will go first and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accurate path, that person can follow the same discovery process.

::note
This education process must be a repeatable process; as was mentioned earlier, Natural Law isn't a religion or a belief system, it is a science.

# Shift Happens

## Quantum Shift

A 'Quantum Shift' in human consciousness is required for humanity to become free of its self-imposed state of slavery.

Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. Anybody who thinks that's the case is very naïve, overly positive, and in some form of right-brain imbalance. Whether or not this shift will occur mainly relies on the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves enormous effort, dedication, and persistence. We cannot give up.

There is a saying in Alchemy that has been referred to as the "catchphrase of the alchemical tradition", the saying goes: &#x2A;**Labore et constantia*** which means "Work and constancy". Constant effort is going to be required to get this boulder up the mountain, and in the condition in which humanity finds itself today, it will most likely go kicking and screaming.

Teaching Natural Law to others is not an easy task, it usually isn't fun, and we're definitely not going to get it done in a day. Therefore, we are going to have to continually work hard on this matter, or the quantum shift simply will not happen at all.

## Requirements

A Quantum Shift Has Requirements. The word quantum is derived from the (same) Latin noun &#x2A;**Quantum*** which means "Amount". In order to tip the scales of truth and justice back into balance, a certain amount of people actually need to be doing the Great Work of helping other people to receive this knowledge of Natural Law. Simply put, higher amounts of people are required.

Individual behavioral choices, either based in harmony or in opposition to Natural Law, combine in energy and effect, and in the aggregate, influence the quality of the manifested shared human experience; we collectively create our shared experience. This dynamic acts as a perfect expression of the principle of Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above." Decisively contrary to the "New age" view.

::note
In order for a quantum shift to happen, higher numbers of people are required.

# The Great Work

## Internal Alignment

From that moment on, the teaching of the Great Work can begin; because once that has been done, there is no more internal contradiction or opposition within that person. From there on out, you can legitimately start teaching it to other people because you know it deeply enough, and have truly aligned your behavior to it. The Great Work is what comes next.

::note
The Great Work is the arduous task of influencing other people to go through that same process of positive change, that you have gone through yourself.
::

It is to help them realize that in supporting and condoning the legitimacy of "authority" and "government (man's law)," they have actually been supporting and condoning the legitimacy of slavery. And that they were immoral for having done so; convincing a person of that is hard work. Because people usually don't want to hear this, they want what they think is true, to be true.

What the Great Work comes down to is to get people to abandon their (false) religions The false and dogmatic beliefs which hold back the progress of consciousness by impeding the reception of knowledge of Natural Law.

> "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable, and therefore, not popular."
> *Carl Gustav Jung, Swiss psychotherapist*

The true Great Work is to become a teacher of Natural Law; and as the old saying goes 'many hands make light work.'

> "Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. That is the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty."
> &#x2A;Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the U.S.A.*

> "In every declining civilization there is a small remnant of people who adhere to the right against the wrong; who recognize the difference between good and evil and who will take an active stand for the former and against the latter; who can still think and discern, and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual decay of their day." - excerpt from the book 'Toward a New World Order' by
> &#x2A;Donald S. McAlvany, Author, "Toward a New World Order"*

The words that are attributed to Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Matthew:

> "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the Earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man's enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
> &#x2A;Jesus Christ, (Matthew 10:34-39)*

If you imagine that these words were in some way "spoken" by the truth instead of Jesus Christ. It's telling you that there will be people in your own family who will not align themselves with right over wrong behavior, they will continue to choose, and to advocate violence and slavery. These are not people you want to continue to align yourself with, if you have truly made an effort to explain what is really taking place.

## What will this battle really be against?

The personal "battle" that must take place will be against the inner demons which exist within the psyche of humankind, namely:

- Egos hardened into "negative knowledge"
- Emotional mind control
- Fear of true freedom

## "Negative Knowledge"

The greatest enemy may not be ignorance, but rather the illusion of knowledge. When a person dismisses information simply because they think they already know it, or think it isn't important. Not only are they not at the starting point for truth discovery; because they are already attached to information
that isn't true. They are put in a negative starting position because they must first unlearn the information they have been conditioned to believe, to even get to the actual starting point. This happens when a person is in left-brain imbalance.

## Emotional Mind Control

"If it's unpleasant, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to see it, and I certainly don't want to tell others about it! I'll just ignore it, and it will go away." What happens when you would do that with, for example, an illness, or any other problem? It doesn't tend to get better, it only gets worse.

Another form of emotional mind control is when a person dismisses information solely because that person dislikes the way the information is being presented, or delivered to them. You cannot determine the veracity of informational content based on how it makes you feel, doing so is a logical fallacy; you cannot "think" with the emotions. While emotions are also extremely important (our "compass" for morality), you can't thoroughly analyze and conclude what's true based only on how something makes you feel. If you are told a lie in a sweet, pleasant and soothing voice, it's still a lie. If you are told a truth in an abrasive, harsh and scratchy voice, it is still truth.

> "Truth is belligerent. Truth is, by its very nature, at war with the forces of falsehood and deceit."
> *Bertolt Brecht, German Poet*

## Fear of True Freedom

The fear of true freedom come from self-loathing due to lack of self-respect (heart of the problem) and from the refusal to own personal responsibility (symptom of the problem).

People that are psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually immature, people who haven't grown up and young children are the kind of people who want to live in perpetual refusal to their personal responsibility (something that is regarded a hallmark of true adulthood and maturity), because they have nested traumatic issues that have led to self-loathing and lack of self-respect.

Until we start to figure out the causal factors of the other manifesting psychological conditions listed above, we are merely dealing with the symptoms, not the root of the problem. If a child doesn't like itself, and they feel they are "not good enough" or "not worthy," all these imagined feelings of inadequacy, and self-loathing. Those are usually the factors that cause their refusal to grow up, and their refusal to take personal responsibility for their actions during adulthood.

::note
Abandonment is the specific type of childhood trauma they have gone through and the root of the fear of true freedom.
::

description: The human species is suffering from very deep-seated parental abandonment issues, that lie at the very core of our global psychological condition; the human condition. Until we deal with that deeply nested psychological trauma, we aren't dealing with the actual root cause of the problem, and we won't get any closer to solving it.

---

## Requirements

**What will be required on the part of those performing the Great Work?**

- Knowledge of the real enemy
- Service to truth
- Courage and persistence
- Practical real-world skills

## Knowledge of The Real Enemy

The real enemy is the ignorant masses. There are people that say: "The Illuminati enslaves humanity." Which is not at all the case; humanity enslaves the real Illuminati (the 'Illuminated (enlightened)' ones). If that term is to be used for anyone, it makes more sense to apply it to actual teachers of Natural Law, the people that know and understand what is written about in this guide are the real "Illuminati." - They are the real "enlightened" ones; the ones with the light, the ones with the knowledge of Natural Law.

::note
Humanity is enslaving itself, and also the true Illuminati: the teachers that are actually living under the conditions of slavery because they are here with the ignorant masses.
::

It almost seems as if people prefer to think: "we're powerless victims, there is no choice involved here, this is something that is just being done to us." While free will is always in existence, and it's a matter of changing one's thoughts, and therefore changing one's choices. And that is our own personal responsibility which can never be given away. Once more, &#x2A;*you are always responsible for your own actions.**

## Service to Truth

Truth can never be destroyed. But humanity can definitely be destroyed, if we refuse to act in service to truth as its defenders. There are people that think truth doesn't need to be defended, which is simply not true. Truth needs to be fended for at all times and places, because the attack on it is never-ending and non-
stop. If we do not come to defend truth; the voice of untruth and deception rules the day, and the voice of truth will not be heard. Since the truth doesn't have its own voice in our physical domain, we must act as its mediums and literally be its voice, if we desire true freedom.

It is definitely possible for us to co-create a positive outcome, but this can only be accomplished if we care enough to learn the truth ourselves, and then develop the courage to speak it to other people.

> "If you love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget you were our countrymen."
> &#x2A;Samuel Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the U.S.A.*

## Persistence

We are the vehicles by which truth operates in our world. Therefore, it is our shared responsibility at this time to help to awaken others by continuously speaking the truth, even if we feel burdened by this task, even if we feel that nobody is listening, and even if it makes all people involved feel uncomfortable.

Nobody ever said that the truth is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside; the truth can be horrible, and yet, it needs to be embraced as a lover.

> "There are only two mistakes one can ever make on the path to truth; not starting, and not going all the way."
> &#x2A;Buddha, Religious leader.*

Lastly, we need practical real-world skills. The end goal isn't to have you just knowing this information for yourself; but to communicate this information to the masses. And to be able to communicate truth to others properly, knowledge and certain skills are required.

Technology is something that improves life for us, and makes life easier for us. In this technological era we live in, it is absolutely crucial that we learn to use this technology as our tools for communication of truth.

**Some examples of those practical skills are:**

- **Organization:** Whether it be a seminar, a meeting, or any other coming together of people.
- **Communication:** Good vocabulary, and choice of words; to communicate concepts clearly.
- **Graphic design:** For making power-point presentations, flyers, websites etc.
- **Presentation:** Whether in front of a group of friends, or an audience full of strangers.
- **Audio:** For making podcasts, or any other form of broadcasting audio.
- **Video:** For making compilations, vlogs, or any other form of video presentation.
- **Website** development: To accumulate your findings and make them accessible to the world.
- **Networking:** Can also be called 'people skills,' referring to direct communication.
- **Marketing & promotion:** To let others know where to find this information.

If most of us do not have these skills, we won't be reaching the optimum number of people. We have to become the new media, that is dedicated to truth, and put it out there for other people's edification.

## Moral Obligation

When we deeply understand knowledge as important as this, we almost have a moral obligation to share it with others; what gives us the right to keep it to ourselves? If it can greatly improve our own lives, and the lives of those around us.

## Outlet

If you keep taking in more and more knowledge, you're building up more and more pressure within yourself. If you don't have an outlet valve for that pressure, you become "Niagara Falls inside a water balloon," one day, it's going to burst.

# At the Crossroads

> “The Dark Ages still reign over all of humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt merely to compete with God. All are intractably septical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think.” :br&#x2A;*Richard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor.**

## Post Apocalyptic Era

We are living in 'Post-Apocalyptic' times, in the literal sense of the word. The word 'Apocalypse' is derived from the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek verb 'Calyptein (καλυπτειν)' which means 'to Cover / to Conceal,' hence the word apocalypse literally means 'to Reveal' or 'to Take out of hiding.' Therefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been lifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out there, and available for most people to find.

## The Cosmic Apology

We have to make, what has been called "The Cosmic Apology". The word 'Apology' is made up of the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek noun 'Logos (λόγος)' which means 'Word.' Hence apology literally means 'to Go away from the word' (to take back something you said), or 'to Give back the word.' If a person says something they didn't really mean, or something they want to retract, they apologize; they are “moving away from” what they have said.

The Greek noun 'Logos' is derived from the Greek verb 'Lego (λεγω)' which means 'to Speak / to Say' (this is where the English word 'Lexicon' comes from). The Latin noun 'Lex / Legis (Law)' is also derived from this same Greek verb. God, not man, is the author (authority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence.

Humanity's work is to learn to listen to God's word, which is, Natural Law, spiritual law, moral law, God's law; and to align its behavior to that law.

Humanity must make this Cosmic Apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to God, and collectively aligning its behavior with Natural Law. This is accomplished when we open our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word 'No' to those who claim to be our owners.

The very beginning of this guide started out with the chapter ["Before we begin"](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/natural-law/before-we-begin).

Now we have begun -->

# Conclusion

> “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the law of Nature for his rule."
> *John Locke, English philosopher*

> “Nature, to be commanded, must first be obeyed."
> *Francis Bacon, former Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England*

If we want the forces of Nature on our side we must learn, and adhere to, the principles of Natural Law. If we do not align our behavior to it, Nature will not stand with us, but will continuously stand against us, and that will create more strife and suffering in our lives.

> “There is a law that man should love his neighbor as himself. In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing, or the upright gait. But if he does not learn it, he must perish."
> *Alfred Adler, Austrian Psychologist*

## The Master Key

This process should be able to be done a lot faster than a few hundred years; if we accept the master key that is shown in this guide. Which has the power to unlock all the locks, and all the doors, to all the mental cages, if we make the decision to climb the "ladder of consciousness" through an act of our own free will choice and effort. Because for most it won't be an easy process; it involves a lot of deep introspective work.

However, if we do this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves, by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine forces within each one of us. And by recognizing our own inherent sovereignty, and recognizing there isn't, and never has been any legitimacy to slavery, control, authority or any other form of external rulership of human beings as subjects.

## Justice

The tarot card pictured here was also shown at the beginning of this guide. There is a deep connection to be understood about the tarot tradition and other mystery traditions regarding knowledge of Natural Law. Specifically, the deeply interwoven relationship to the Middle-Eastern Kabbalistic tradition.

This tarot card is known as the Justice Card (Justice: based on the Latin word &#x2A;**Jus*** meaning "Right or Law"). This card represents balance between the two pillars of Enlightenment (Feminine and Masculine), Holding the sword of truth in the right hand, and the scales of justice perfectly balanced in the left hand.

This Justice card represents sovereignty, alignment with truth, and the manifestation of order, which can only happen when we align our behaviors to the principles of Natural Law.

## True Freedom

If we let go of the habits that are holding us back and break the mental chains of bondage, we can create a world that is based on true freedom. It may be a difficult journey, but it can be done. And if we all choose to do so, we're going to see advances and creations beyond what we have ever experienced here on Earth. The world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of Natural Law. The changes we will experience are going to be so positive, and so transformative that we can barely even imagine what the world will look like on the other side of that work.

It is up to each and every one of us, personally, to take on that responsibility and go down that path for ourselves; should we hope to ever reach that point. The main task now is to inform as many people as possible about the workings of Natural Law, true morality, and freedom.

# Introduction

## De-Occultation is our purpose

For centuries, the core principles governing reality, consciousness, and morality have been fragmented, obscured, or guarded as "occult" (hidden) knowledge. This has created systems of control, confusion, and dependence.

Our mission is **de-occultation**. We make this knowledge whole, clear, and permanently accessible. We hold that understanding the immutable laws of nature is the prerequisite for individual sovereignty and a free society. This is not a matter of belief, but of demonstrable truth.

## What this repository contains

::tip
The Doctrine is built upon seminal work and is a comprehensive synthesis of 

**Natural Law**

 and 

**Hermetic**

 wisdom.
::

Here you will find:

::card-group{.my-12}
  :::card{icon="i-local-book-open-text" title="The Core Transcripts"}
  The complete, verbatim text of the foundational teachings, carefully segmented and annotated for study.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-lock-open" title="The Principles Decrypted"}
  Clear explanations of the universal operating principles, including the seven Hermetic laws and the generative eighth principle of **Care**.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-scale" title="The Framework of Natural Law"}
  An objective exploration of morality, rights, freedom, and the consequences of human action, derived from first principles.
  :::

  :::card{icon="i-local-crown" title="The Path of Sovereignty"}
  Guidance on internal alignment ("The Internal Monarchy") and the external moral obligation ("The Great Work").
  :::
::

## Immutable Truth, Living Repository

::note
The 

**principles**

 documented here are immutable. They do not change, evolve, or submit to opinion. They are the consistent laws upon which reality operates.
::

This **repository**, however, is a living project. While the core truth is fixed, our collective understanding, expression, and accessibility of it can always improve. This site is built for that purpose: to be clarified, translated, and expanded upon by a global community.

## Two Ways to Engage

1. **Read and Learn:** This is first and foremost a library. Use the navigation to study the material sequentially or explore specific topics. It is freely available to all.
2. **Contribute and Steward:** This is also an open-source project. If you are skilled in translation, writing, or code, you can help improve the clarity, reach, and utility of this knowledge for everyone. See our [Contribution Guide](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/contribute/introduction) to begin.

## The Freemavens Collective

This Doctrine is the foundational text for **The Freemavens Collective**. The Collective is the community of practice - where individuals apply this knowledge, support each other's growth, and collaborate on the "Great Work" of education and elevation.

Think of it this way:

- **The Doctrine is the map.**
- **The Collective is the expedition.**

You are welcome to study the map on your own. If you seek fellowship, structured guidance, and active projects, you are invited to [join the expedition](https://thefreemavens.org){rel="&#x22;nofollow&#x22;"}.

## A Final Word

This project is an act of restoration. It is an attempt to return a vital piece of humanity's operating manual to the public domain. We proceed with humility toward the truth and responsibility toward each other.

Thank you for being here. Your attention is the first step.

**Proceed to [Usage](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/getting-started/usage) for a guide to this repository of knowledge, or begin exploring the [Open Doctrine of Natural Law](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/natural-law/summary).**


# Usage

## The Two Modes of Use

This site is designed for two primary modes, reflecting your stage of learning:

1. **The Linear Path (For First-Time Study):** Follow the chapters in sequence to build a complete understanding.
2. **The Reference Mode (For Review & Research):** Use the search and reference sections to find specific concepts.

## 1. Starting the Linear Path: The Recommended Study Order

For a complete understanding, follow the chapters in the order presented in the **main navigation sidebar*&#x2A; under &#x2A;*"Study the Doctrine."** This path is deliberately sequential; each chapter builds upon concepts introduced in earlier ones.

- **Do not skip around on your first pass.** Start with the **Introduction** and proceed step-by-step.
- The sidebar will always show your **current position** and the **next chapter**.
- Tip: Use your browser's bookmark function to save your progress.

## 2. Navigating a Chapter Page

Each chapter (e.g., "Principle of Care") is a self-contained unit with integrated multimedia. Here’s what you’ll find and how to use it:

- **Chapter Title & Description:** At the top. Read this to understand the chapter's core focus.
- **"On This Page" Side Navigation:** On the right (or left on mobile). Use these links to **jump instantly** to specific sections within the long chapter page, such as the video segment, key slides, or transcript analysis.
- **The Integrated Content:**
  - **Video Segment:** An embedded player for the specific seminar portion. Click to play.
  - **Slides:** Key visual aids from the video. **Click any slide to enlarge it** for detailed study.
  - **Transcript & Essay:** The written core of the chapter. This text elaborates on the video, providing definitions, context, and deeper explanation.

## 3. Using the Search System (Your Primary Research Tool)

The **search icon (🔍) in the top header** is your most powerful tool for reference and review.

1. **Click the search icon** to open the search modal.
2. **For Immediate Answers:** Start typing a term (e.g., "Care," "Mentalism," "spiritual currency") in the search bar. Results will appear in real-time.
3. **To Browse the Full Structure:** Look at the **categorized site map** listed below the search bar. This shows you every page, organized by section (Getting Started, Study the Doctrine, Reference, Contribute). It's the perfect way to grasp the site's entire scope at a glance.

## 4. Using the Reference Sections

Once you grasp the core material, these sections become invaluable:

- **Glossary:** Located under **Reference** in the main nav. Use this to find precise definitions of key terms like "De-occultation," "Generative Principle," or "The Great Work."
- **Resources:** A curated list of external books, lectures, and tools related to Natural Law and the principles discussed here.
- **FAQ:** Answers to common questions about the project, the content, and the philosophy behind it.

## 5. Getting Involved: The Contribution Path

If you wish to move from study to stewardship - by translating, clarifying text, or reporting issues - all the practical guides are in the **Contribute** section. Start with the [Contribution Overview](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/fr/contribute/introduction) page.

## Quick Start Checklist

- **First-time visitor?** Start with the [Introduction](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/fr/natural-law/introduction) and follow the linear path.
- **Looking for a specific concept?** Use the &#x2A;*Search (🔍)** function in the header.
- **Need a definition?** Check the [Glossary](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/fr/reference/glossary).
- **Want to help improve the site?** Visit the [Contribute](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/fr/contribute/introduction) section.

---

*This site is a blend of a structured course and a living reference. We recommend using the linear path for foundational learning and the search/reference tools for the rest of your journey.*

---

This page now directly addresses both user types with clear instructions tailored to your site's specific features (linear nav, search modal, chapter layout). It should significantly reduce confusion and support effective learning.

# Introduction

::tip
You are free to share this guide with as many people you like. It is crucial to our freedom that more people will be exposed to this great body of knowledge and act on it.
::

::note
As a whole, the body of knowledge presented here has the potential to save humanity from its current state of slavery

## Definitions & Key Concepts:

### Natural Law

Natural Law is a set of universal, objective, eternal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions which govern the consequences of behaviors of beings with the capacity for understanding the difference between harmful and non-harmful actions.

### Objective Morality

The understanding of Natural Law is centred upon bringing one's own conscience into alignment with objective morality. This means definitively knowing which behaviors are rights; because they do not cause harm to other sentient beings, and which behaviors are wrongs because they do cause harm to other sentient beings.

### Exercising Conscience

Living in harmony with Natural Law means exercising conscience, and wilfully choosing morally right behavior over morally wrong behavior, once the difference between the two is clearly understood.

### Cause & Effect

When people begin to live in harmony with Natural Law in the aggregate, and are therefore
moral, they become and remain free. When people live in opposition to Natural Law, and are
therefore immoral, they become and remain enslaved.

### Positive Change

If you want to come to a proper understanding of what Natural Law is exactly, and how it
works in the world around you. If you wonder how it came to be that relatively small groups
of people calling themselves governments control the lives of billions of people worldwide.
If you want to definitively know the difference between right and wrong behavior, and make
a positive change in your own life and the lives of the people around you, this will be of
interest to you.

# Before We Begin...

::note
This first lesson is called before we begin, and "begin" is the key word here.
::

::tip
If you feel that the current human condition and life on Earth are tolerable just the way they are, and you are content with our global situation as it is now, then there is nothing for you to find here.

The information you will encounter in this guide as a whole, and lessons in parts, is not new information. While it will most likely be new to most who read it, all of this information can be found in numerous different books, seminars, and lectures written by numerous different people.

## Key Concepts & Requirements:

### 1. Put Feelings Aside

Some of you are likely to be angered by some of the things you are about to read, so be it. The fact of the matter is that truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent; because it “wages war” against all forms of falsehood and deception. If you wish to take away any real value from reading this guide, you should make a deliberate effort to be consciously aware of any impulses you may have to reject certain information presented, solely based on your initial emotional reaction to it.

### 2. Avoid Logical Fallacies

It is a logical fallacy to gauge the veracity (truthfulness) of any information based on how you feel when first hearing it; because you cannot “think” with the emotions. If you read something you don't like, or something that angers you, that's okay, feel the emotion.
But don't immediately tell yourself it can't be true.

### 3. Do Due Diligence

Of course you shouldn't just believe anything you read here either; it's about checking the information for yourself, and to actually start researching this material for yourself.
And this is a great place to start that journey.

### 4. Stay Objective

However, this entire guide is a tapestry. Like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle; it is meant to be seen and taken in as a whole, in its entirety.

### 5. Recognize Patterns

It is highly recommended that you read the entire guide from beginning to end, otherwise, you will most likely not recognize the patterns inherent to the tapestry.

### 6. Accept what is True

As the old saying goes: “There is nothing new under the sun.” This simply means that truth is singular and eternal. It has always been here and will always be here; it is our perceptions that must be aligned to it.

### Transcript + Slides

Okay, I want to say thanks to each and every one of you for being here today, it’s going to be a great day. I’m going to go through what I consider to be the very heart of my material. And people ask me a lot, they say; “you put out a lot of material on your website, what is the main thing? If you had to tell me what is the main thing that I should check out if I check out nothing else that’s up there, what would it be?” And I always tell them the same thing; it’s the material on Natural Law. If nothing else, that’s the material that you need to understand deeply. So that’s what we’re going to be covering here today in an extended presentation format. I want to go through a few things before we actually get started, so I call this section “before we begin.”

And the word begin is actually important here because that's what this presentation is actually about, it's initiation. This is an initiation into really, really deep, esoteric material that has been hidden from humanity for millennia.

(Slide 2) So, I just want to ask people before we get started, how many of you are new, or relatively new to my work by a show of hands please? That's excellent, this is great. That is great news, I am so glad to hear that. What I actually didn't want is to come hear and talk to a bunch of people who are already totally familiar with my work and have already heard it. So this is great.

(Slide 2.1) How many of you here today feel that the human condition and life on earth for humanity right now is tolerable just the that way that it is, by a show of hands? That's also pretty good because if that was the case, I was going to say there's nothing for here you today, there's the door. So that's good that we're all hungry for change. One of the big complaints I hear about my work, when I check in on forums or something or read some YouTube comments; many people will say “there's nothing new here, I've heard this before somewhere else, this person covers this, I've read this in this book.” Well ladies and gentlemen, I have news for you: there is nothing new here. I am not going to present anything new. I am not going to present anything that has not actually been in existence and will continue to be in existence. I'm not making up new material. I would refer to myself- Art (Capozzi) said it the other day, actually yesterday when we were having dinner; he said “I consider you an aggregator of material,” and I love that term, I love that description of what I do. I am an aggregator, I bring things together into a tapestry and then help to explain it in simple and easy-to-understand terms so that people can readily absorb it, take it in and do something with that information. (Slide 2.2) So, you will not be seeing or hearing anything “new” here today. As the old saying goes, in all the old mystery traditions, “there is nothing new under the sun.” And what that phrase actually means- many people don't know what that phrase means. that the truth is singular and eternal. Truth has always been here, among us, and it will always be here. It is our perception that must be aligned with it. So there's nothing new you're going to hear today, okay. These are eternal truths that have always been here among us.

(Slide 3) Another aspect I want to cover before we get started is about my presentation style. This is another thing that I get a lot of complaints about and it's something I have no intention of changing. My presentation style has been described by some as extremely intense and at times, even combative. This is a word many people will use to describe my presentation style. Some of you here today are very likely to be angered by some of the things you may hear me say during the duration of this seminar, and I say so be it. That's okay. If you get angry that's okay. The fact of the matter is that Truth itself, by its very nature, is belligerent. And I'll actually be putting up a quote to that nature later on in the presentation. The reason Truth is belligerent is because it is actually at war. It's at war with the lie, it's at war with deception, it's at war with mind control. So Truth can be belligerent. Many people don't want to hear it when they first encounter it. I tell people all the time: I don't do this, or I don't present this information to be liked. I don't do this to make friends. I'm not interested in making a whole bunch of new friends. If it happens, that's great, but that's not the reason I do what I do. I don't do this to be popular. I don't do this to make money. It's not a popularity contest. Telling people many things that they don't want to hear is not going to make you popular, or it's not going to make you a whole lot of new friends. So those aren't the reasons I do what I do. To be honest, I tell people this and sometimes they get upset by just hearing this; “I don't even really want to do this.” I don't want to do this with my life. I don't want to do this with my time. As I already know, understand and live the information I'm going to present. So I get this, I know this, okay. I don't need to keep going over this over and over and over again for my own entertainment. The reason that I actually do this is because I recognize that, in a time of such overwhelming ignorance of this critical information, this information which is capable of saving humanity from it's current condition. The fact that I do already understand this information places me in a position of moral obligation and responsibility. That's why I do what I do. I'm in a position of moral obligation to speak this information to other people in an effort to help to get them to understand it and live it as well. And that is the reason I do this.

(Slide 4) Every person here today who wishes to take real world value, practical value from this seminar here today, I'm going to ask them to make a deliberate and conscious effort to do two things. The first is, try to set aside, to the extent that you capable of doing so, you're perceptions of me as the presenter. This includes things like how you think I look, how I dress, the sound of my voice, my mannerisms, etc. Try to set those things aside to the extent that you are able to do it. I know that is difficult for some and I say this because paying attention to such trivialities will detract your own mental focus away from the information that is being presented today. And that's the worst thing that could happen because it is the information that is important, not me. Try to ignore me and focus on the content.The second thing I ask people to try to do is to be consciously aware, of any of your own impulses that you may have here today to immediately reject the information that is being presented in this seminar based solely upon your own initial emotional reaction, your initial emotional response to this information. This is a logical fallacy: you cannot think with the emotions, so if you hear something you don't like, or that angers you, that's ok. Feel the emotion, but don't just immediately say “that can't be true.” But don't believe me either. It's about checking it. It's about a process of truth discovery. It's about doing your own due diligence and actually researching this material. But if you try to gauge the veracity, meaning the truthfulness of this information solely based upon on how it makes you feel when hearing it, you are committing a logical fallacy. So I ask people to try as much as possible to suspend immediate reactions of disbelief and saying “no, I don't want to accept that, no it can't be true” based on how something may make you feel that you hear today. That's very important to keep in mind.

(Slide 5) And lastly, this information, the entire seminar, is a tapestry. It's like pieces of a huge jigsaw puzzle. It is meant to be seen and taken as a whole in its entirety. Now I know I'm asking a lot here too because it's going to be a long day. My goal here, my work here is to keep your interest and your attention and your focus throughout the entire course of this seminar, and that's a challenging thing to do. What I'm asking people is, you have to try to see it as a whole because if you took the time to be here and gave a monetary donation to be here, I'm highly recommending that you stay for the whole duration of the seminar. There's a reason for that; you're only going to get the full tapestry, especially if you're new to my work, by hearing this information in its entirety. So if you don't do that, you probably won't recognize the patterns, which is what this is all about. That's what this day is all about, pattern recognition, that are inherent to this tapestry of information and more likely than not, you'll have wasted the time it took for you to be here today and wasted the money you spent to be here today. So I don't want anybody to waste their time and their money and their attention, and I don't think you do either. So that's why I'm asking people, stay for the whole thing; you'll get the maximum value out of this seminar if you stay for its duration. So with that having been said, let's jump into the material.

(Slide 6) This presentation is called Natural Law: The Real Law of Attraction and how to apply it in your life. And I emphasize that term real law of attraction. Many people will be familiar with the new age variants of the so-called law or laws of attraction. This is going to differ quite widely from what people have heard in the new age community and the new age movement regarding what the law or laws of attraction are. These are the real laws of attraction we're going to be hearing today and hopefully understanding today. Let's start in.


# Teachability

## Low Teachability

Low teachability derives from arrogance and rigid skepticism, but also from naiveté and gullibility.

## High Teachability

High teachability derives from a balance between healthy skepticism and an open- minded willingness to learn, and more importantly, the willingness to change.

## Consider Your Sources

People should consider with great care their sources for information. Because by refusing to present certain information, and by influencing people to dismiss certain information as unimportant or unnecessary to consider, many modern institutions (like the mainstream media, or so-called “educational” institutions) seek to control human perceptions, and by doing so, limit what human beings may come to understand. By limiting what a person is able to understand, a person is automatically limited in what they are able to do, what they are able to change, and what they are able to create.

So again, you should not just believe anything you read here.
You need to look into the information written about in this guide for yourself, and most importantly, personal introspection is necessary; to really feel within whether or not this information resonates with truth. Every person has that intuitive capacity to a certain degree.

# Requirements & the Role of Knowledge

## Intro

People everywhere say that they want certain conditions to be present for both themselves and their species as a whole, such as happiness, health, peace, freedom, etc. Which of course, are all great things to aspire to, and most people will say that they want these things. However, it feels as though they aren't being completely honest with themselves, because when they are told that those aren't automatic conditions that manifest themselves, and that there are specific requirements for us to obtain these conditions, they usually don't want to hear about it. Also, people wouldn't say they want these conditions if they were already omnipresent. People say they want something because they don't already have it, whether it be partially, or in full.

## Requirements

This is what the real law of attraction is about; it explains that conditions of which you say you want them, don't automatically manifest by thinking of them, or just having a feeling about them. There are certain requirements for obtaining those conditions.
Of course, this statement only counts if you want something to be different than the way it already is; if you're completely okay with the way things are now, requirement doesn't exist.

## Knowledge

We need to know certain things. Knowledge that will ultimately lead us to positive action is
what's required. Specifically, the knowledge of the requirements to obtaining the conditions
we say we want. However, if this knowledge is absent it obviously can't be obtained and used
to create change. But if it is present, then it must be wilfully being ignored, and as long as this
knowledge continues to remain unknown or ignored, the manifestation of the desired
conditions will be impossible. And that is exactly what this guide is about; what those
requirements are, and what this knowledge consists of.

# Occult Knowledge

## Hidden Knowledge

This knowledge is "Occulted", meaning it ~~is~~ was "Hidden".

Derived from the Latin adjective &#x2A;**Occultus**&#x2A; which means "concealed, hidden from sight", which is in turn derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Occultare**&#x2A; which means "to keep secret, to conceal." Just like in English, the word &#x2A;**Ocular**&#x2A; means "related to the eye, related to sight", which is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Oculus*** meaning "Eye".

::note
Occult Knowledge is certain information that has been hidden from sight for a specific reason.
::

Occult Knowledge constitutes both the Knowledge of [Human Consciousness]{.font-bold.border-b} and how it operates, and the Knowledge of [Natural Law]{.font-bold.border-b}, the unseen universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of human behavior.

In the ancient mystery traditions and occult schools, these concepts are known as the two 'Arcana' which translates to 'Secret' in both Latin and Greek ('Arcanum (μυστικό)' in Greek)

## Minor Arcana

The Lesser (Minor) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the microcosm - Deals with individual units of consciousness; the human psyche.

## Major Arcana

The Greater (Major) Arcana: Hidden knowledge of the macrocosm - Understanding of the
large (universal) laws of Nature that govern the macrocosm - Natural Law.

# Natural Law

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Natural**&#x2A; is derived from the Egyptian word &#x2A;**Neter**&#x2A; (also &#x2A;**Ntr**&#x2A;) which translates to "Spirit, God" and the suffix &#x2A;**-al**&#x2A;, which, just as in English, means: "Related to, of, having come from". Therefore, it can be readily seen that the word &#x2A;**Natural**&#x2A; &#x2A;(Neter + -al)* means "Related to- or, having come from Spirit or God".

## Meaning

Natural Law means the universal spiritual laws which govern the consequences of behavior for intelligent species; Beings that are capable of coming to an understanding of their own existence, and their consciousness. And also capable of understanding the objective difference between harmful and non-harmful behavior towards themselves and other beings. This does not include the animal kingdom. For the very same reason you wouldn't attempt to teach mathematics to your cat or dog, this same goes for animals understanding Natural Law. This is because we don't share the same level of consciousness.

## Power Differential

Sadly, within the human population such knowledge also isn't commonly known, because it has been deliberately hidden in order to create and maintain a power differential between those who know that information, and those who are ignorant of it.

## Level the Playing Field

The knowledge of Natural Law and the way it operates constitute some of the most deeply occulted information on Earth, which the powers that be seek to keep hidden from the people, because the understanding of this information would level the playing field and put an end to the currently operating systems of control.

# Nescience vs. Ignorance: the Contexts of Not Knowing

::note
The term nescience is one that has been practically “deleted” from colloquial English.
::

## Nescience

There are two contexts to not knowing something; the first term 'Nescience' is derived from the Latin verb 'Nescire,' which means 'to Not know something because necessary information was absent or unattainable.' The prefix 'Ne-' in Latin means 'Not / Not Present / Absent.' The second part of the word nescience is derived from the Latin verb 'Scio / Sciero' which means 'I know.'

Therefore, in case of nescience it is impossible for a person to aggregate necessary information. Contrary to ignorance, nescience isn't a person's fault; the information simply isn't available for them to perceive.

## Ignorance

The term 'Ignorance' is derived from the Latin verb 'Ignorare' which means 'to Not know something, even though necessary information is present; because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.' This is usually because of disinterest or contradicting beliefs. Ignorance, contrary to nescience, carries blame. Because the person has wilfully chosen to ignore the information.

For the vast majority of people this information is readily available to them, but most people choose to ignore it because they feel they don't need to know it, or because it contradicts something they believe in. Therefore, we live in an ignorant society.

## Your Master Key

What this guide constitutes is a master-key it is accepted (not believed). This process starts by perceiving truth's presence, acknowledging truth's presence, accepting it for what it truly is, and then finally and most importantly, to do something with it.

Understanding this information is not where this work ends; taking in this knowledge and understanding it is only the beginning. If you want to create change, action is required.

## Courage to Change

People often say, 'change happens in the heart' or 'change happens in the mind,' which is true, but lastly it happens in the guts. If you have the “guts” to do something, you have developed the courage to do something. We must develop all three, heart, mind and guts; we must care enough to know, and then finally convert that knowledge into action. Because taking action is the most important step towards creating change in the physical realm.

::note
Knowledge --> Understanding --> Action

# Problem Solving

## Overcome Fear

Fear-based denial must first be dealt with and conquered; because denial will only make the problem grow bigger.

## Diagnose Accurately

Recognize that symptoms are merely effects of underlying causes. Instead of treating symptoms, you must make an accurate diagnosis of the cause(s) of the problem. (Diagnosis: from the Greek preposition 'Dia- (δια)' meaning 'Through / By way of,' and the Greek noun 'Gnosis (γνωσις)' which means 'Knowledge.' The term 'Diagnosis' etymologically means 'By way of knowledge') And in doing so, you will come to an understanding of what cause has put certain symptoms into effect.

## Act

Through the knowledge acquired via accurate diagnosis, take the required action(s) necessary to rectify the causal factors which led to the manifestation of the problem.

# Truth vs. Perception

For some reason, when people hear the term &#x2A;**Truth*** most tend to immediately jump to incredibly mystified concepts of what truth is (to them); starting to immediately relate the concept to God, or something else that is completely irrelevant. All this is, is mystification and obfuscation of what truth actually is.

Perception is not equal to reality or truth. For example, when a person who is visually impaired removes their glasses. Reality (truth) will remain the same, while the perception of that individual may drastically change.

description: Truth is objective, meaning it is not based on the perceptions of human beings. This alone can be seen as an assault on the human ego; as everybody likes to think their perceptions are important and accurate.

## Perceptions

People's perceptions can differ slightly from the truth, or they can differ wildly from the truth. The truth does not waver, it does not move, bend, or change; it is that which is. It doesn't matter whether anybody believes it, knows it, sees it, nor if anybody wants to see it. It's there, it has always been there, and it will always be there. Nobody can change what has already happened, the past can impossibly be altered. Unlike the future; and the alteration of the future begins in the present moment.

## Truth

All that truth is, is all that has happened in the past, and that which is happening at the present moment. That which is, and that which has been.

Whenever the term &#x2A;**Truth*** is used in this guide, that is all that is being referred to.
In the picture shown here, imagine the white lines which do not waver to be truth, and every coloured line to be the perception of an individual. Their ability to perceive what has occurred, and what is occurring, can be referred to as consciousness (a being's ability to
recognize patterns and meaning inside, and around themselves), which can be either accurate, or inaccurate.

::todo
Add Diagram
::

In case of a low frequency vibration (red line), the wavelength will be longer, and the wave
won't frequently hit the white line. In case of a high frequency vibration (blue line), the wavelength will be a lot shorter, and the wave hits the white line a lot more frequently.
The higher the frequency of a person's consciousness is, the more their wave of perception
hits the unwavering line of truth.

# Solipsism

::note
People who are solipsists, whether they know they are or not, usually have a destructive influence on society.
::

[]{.mb-8.invisible}

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Solipsism**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin adjective &#x2A;**Solus**&#x2A; which means "Alone", or "Only"
and the Latin pronoun &#x2A;**Ipse*** which means "Self", or "Myself" - "Only myself", or "the Self alone".

## Ideology

The ideology of a solipsist is: "Nothing exists outside of me, I am the only being that exists in creation, and everything I perceive is created by me". Or in other words, "I am God". They believe that their perception is the only real perception, and that nobody else outside themselves truly even exists.

What this guide teaches, is that your perception isn't always truth. You have to work to align your perceptions with the truth. Hearing this can already be damaging enough to the ego for some people. But what a solipsist believes is that you don't even exist, and your existence is fully based on his or her perception. Therefore, in their mind, so are your perceptions.

## The Third Sin

Solipsism also happens to be the third sin of Satanism, meaning that Satanists don't want any
solipsism within their own community of followers, but they think it's fine for others to live according to this ideology. The first sin of Satanism happens to be stupidity, which is also something that is looked down upon within their community, but considered fine for others.

## Comfortable Ignorance

In short, solipsism is the ideology that only one's own mind is sure to exist. Solipsists contend that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. Therefore, to them, there is no such thing as objective truth, and nothing about the external world and its workings can actually truly be known.

::note
This state of mind only ensures a person to feel comfortable in their ignorance and laziness.

# Definition of Natural Law

Before we look at the definition of Natural Law, let's look at the definition of the word &#x2A;**Definition*** - "An exact statement or description of the nature, scope, or meaning of a word, concept, or object. Also, the degree of clarity of an object, image, or sound; for example, a high definition television."

::note
To define is to make something (de)finite, as opposed to infinite.
::

The more accurate our definitions for words or concepts are, the better our clarity of meaning, and therefore, our understanding of those words or concepts will be. Therefore, 'Definition' means 'Clarity of meaning' when applying it to words and concepts.

Since most of this guide is going to be about Natural Law from here on out, you must know the
definition of the concept:

## Natural

Inherent, or Having a basis in Nature, reality, and truth. Also, not made or caused by humankind.

## Law

An existing condition which is both binding and immutable (cannot be changed).

## Working Definition

description: Universal, non-man-made, binding and immutable conditions that govern the consequences of behavior for all intelligent beings. Natural Law is a set of universal spiritual laws which act as the governing dynamics of consciousness.

## The Science of Natural Law

Natural Law is a testable hypothesis, meaning it is testable by scientific methodology:

- Question →
- Gather information →
- Hypothesis →
- Observe →
- Analyze and test data →
- Draw conclusion →
- Communicate your results.

::note
Natural Law is not a religion or a belief system, but a science.

# Discovery vs. Belief

## Natural Law Vs. Religion

Natural Law is capable of being discovered, understood, and harmonized with; unlike religion, which asks to believe, accept as is, and do without question.

## Belief is Irrelevant

You could best try to understand the way Natural Law works like you understand the law of gravity, and therefore wouldn't walk over the edge of a cliff. The Law of Gravity does not require your belief to be in effect; and neither does Natural Law.

Belief is completely irrelevant when it comes to the existence and operation of all laws of Nature, such as Gravity, Inertia, Momentum, Thermodynamics, and Electromagnetism. Similar to such other phenomena of Nature, the workings of Natural Law don't require belief in order to be operational, discovered, and known.

# Consciousness & the Brain

## Definition

***Consciousness*** is the ability of a being to recognize patterns and meaning with respect to events taking place; both within oneself, and in the realm in which the being exists and operates. In other words...

::note
Consciousness is the ability to accurately perceive truth; that which has happened, and that which is happening at the present moment.
::

## Expressions of Consciousness

The abilities we have, to make ourselves known to any other being around us. These expressions are:

## Thoughts

Creative (neutral) force. (both Masculine and Feminine).

## Emotions:

Internal expression. (Feminine).

## Actions

Result of thought and emotion being expressed into the physical realm. (Masculine)

Like in almost all major religious traditions, this represents the 'Holy Trinity':
The father creator (thoughts), and the sacred feminine figure (emotions), which the father
figure impregnates or inseminates in some way. From that offspring a male child is born, always. The birth of this male child symbolizes that the 'saviour' of humanity will be action; faith alone will not be enough.

Even in modern Christianity, in their own exoteric scriptures, there is only one prescription
that the Christ-figure gives to the people when asked about freedom (John 8:32) -

::note
You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.

# Brain Structure & Behavior

**The three main complexes that comprise the human brain are:**

1. The R-Complex (Reptilian Brain): Basic survival functions
2. The Limbic system (Mammalian Brain): Human emotion
3. The Neocortex (Human Brain): Higher thought functions and consciousness

## R-Complex

The R-Complex becomes active when we are in 'fight-or-flight' mode; when survival is at stake. This part of the brain also controls basic motor skills and respiration. It is comprised of the brain stem and the cerebellum. It is the lowest conscious part of the brain, meaning it is not a “thinking” part of the brain, merely a part of the brain that reacts to stimulus.

## Limbic system

The Limbic system, also referred to as the 'mid-brain,' makes it possible for us to feel in our physical realm. It does this by releasing neuropeptides into the bloodstream via different glands that comprise the limbic system, for example: the pineal gland, the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary gland etc. It is the part of our brain which makes all human emotions possible. If this particular part of the brain would not function properly, you would not be able to experience a normal range of human emotions.

This is partially what psychopathy is; with psychopaths this part of the brain does not function properly. Which could be due to some form of birth disorder, or from chronic conditions in somebody's life which have “numbed” this particular part of the brain.

## Neocortex

The Neocortex is structurally the highest part of the brain, and evolutionary the newest part of the brain. The word 'Neo' derives from the Greek adjective 'Néos (νέος)' which means 'New.' It's where all the electrochemical activity that comprise our 'human modes of thought' take place; that which we consider the things in thought that make us human, and separate us from the animal kingdom. By higher thought functions is meant, for example: logic, intuition, creativity etc. It is essentially the outer layer of the brain's grey matter. As far as evolutionary development of the human brain goes, it is the newest part of our brain structure.

---

## Brain Hemispheres

The brain structure also include two hemispheres which are bilaterally symmetrical, meaning they are able to be divided into approximate mirrored images of each other along the midline. The two separate halves generally control different functions of the brain.

## Left Brain

The left hemisphere is the intellectual part of the brain (masculine): logic, analytical thought, math etc.

## Right Brain

The right hemisphere is the intuitive part of the brain (feminine): creativity, intuition, compassion etc.

::tip
When there is a healthy balance between the two hemispheres of the brain, that's when real consciousness, and pattern recognition is developed. As well as true morality, and ethical consideration.
::

## Intellect ≠ Intelligence

Intellect is not the same as intelligence. Intellect is left brain understanding; while intelligence is holistic understanding, with the right brain included in the process.

The word &#x2A;**Intelligence**&#x2A; is made up of &#x2A;**Intelli**&#x2A; + &#x2A;**Gence**&#x2A;. The "Intelli" part derives from the word "Intellect", and "Gence" comes from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Gignere*** which means "to Generate, to Create, or to Bring forth". So, intellect + creativity, or logic + compassion etc., that is real intelligence; holistic intelligence. Sadly, most people in our society are not holistically intelligent, they are usually in some form of either left- or right brain imbalance.

## Brain Imbalance

If the left brain becomes chronically dominant, the R-Complex will take over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by selfishness and base desires. They usually develop a personality based on domination and control.

If the right brain becomes chronically dominant, the Limbic System takes over executive function of the brain, and the person will become ruled by their own emotions. They usually develop a personality based on submissiveness and naiveté.

# Human Nature

What is the nature of a computer? - To compute information; which is nor good, nor bad.

## Like a Computer

Human nature is to take in information, process it, and output in the form of behavior. Human beings are not computers, however, much like a computer, human beings are programmable.

Similar to a computer, if a human has a bad "file-system format" (conditions during a child's formative ears), a bad “operating system” (culture / environment), and bad “software programs” (erroneous, rigid, and dogmatic beliefs), their “output” (behavior) onto the “screen” (life) will also be bad. Therefore, these people will contribute to deteriorating conditions on a mass scale, for themselves, and all other beings around them.

The behavior of any person will largely depend upon his or her programming; the quality of the information being taken in by them, which enables them to process and create efficiently.

- Garbage in ---> Garbage out
- Quality in ---> Quality out

## Knowledge

(Or lack thereof): Available information - This constitutes potential knowledge that may be generated,
processed, understood, and acted upon by individuals.

## Understanding

(Or lack thereof): Decision-making process - These processes take place in the mind and are chosen by each
individual based upon available information.

## Wisdom

(Or lack thereof): Human behavior - Each individual's behavior is based upon the quality of their decision-
making processes. Which are based upon the quality of their available information.

::note
Wisdom is not the same as knowledge or understanding.
::

Wisdom is either action, or inaction, always. It is knowledge and understanding which has
been applied. For example, knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit, wisdom is not putting it in a fruit
salad.

## Generated Result

(Order or chaos): Manifested reality - The quality of the condition which manifests in any society is based upon the aggregate quality of human behavior within that society.

# Principles of Natural Law

## The Principles

### Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Principle**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Principia*** which means "First, Foremost, Leading, or Most necessary". In other words, that which is most important.

**These are the eight principles of Natural Law:**

**All is mind; the universe is mental.** Thoughts lead to the manifestation of all things and events in creation. Thoughts create our state of existence and the quality of our experience here on Earth. Therefore, be responsible for everything you create, by being responsible for everything you think.

**As above so below.** That which is above is like to that which is below, that which is below is like to that which is above. The macrocosm (the totality) and the microcosm (the individual units of consciousness which comprise the whole) are reflections of one another. The universe is self-similar across all scales.

**Nothing rests, everything moves.** At the most fundamental level, the universe and everything that comprises it, is pure vibratory energy manifesting itself in different ways. The universe has no 'solidity' as such; the universe is 'holographic.' Matter is merely energy in a state of vibration.

**Everything is dual, everything has poles.** Everything has its opposite. Opposites are identical in nature, but different in degree (e.g. hot and cold are seemingly opposites, while all that cold truly is, is the absence of heat energy). At some level of reality, all things that seems contradictory may be reconciled.

**Cause and effect.** Every cause has its effect, and every effect has its cause. Everything happens according to law. Chance is but a name for law not recognized. There are many planes of causation, but nothing escapes law. There is no free will to ignore law without consequence; that is the limit of free will. This is why Natural Law is also sometimes referred to as Consequentialism.

**Care, not compassion.** Whatever you give attention to, and help to grow. This does not mean you shouldn't care for any negative things happening in the world because you think that will feed into it and give power to it; if that happens only ignorance is being fed into it. By ignoring the negative, you are ensuring that more of it will occur. The lost principle is the dynamic of care; that which you actually care enough about to do, to spend your time on, to pay attention to, and to manifest into reality.

::note
What we care about on a day-to-day basis acts as the driving force of our thoughts and actions.
::

What we as conscious beings need to develop are heart, mind, and guts, in that order. We must care enough to know, and then act accordingly to that understood knowledge. All three must be in place to gain unity consciousness; unifying thoughts, emotions, and actions. Therefore, care can be seen as the ultimate generator of the quality of our experience of life.

Hence the 8th principle is also known as the generative principle. True care is created in our hearts, the 'pump' that causes our blood to flow through our body, in many ancient traditions they spoke of the 'life force' being in the blood. As important as the brain is, the heart is ultimately generating the experience. Because what we care about becomes what we think about, and therefore, how we behave.

That which we care enough about to put our will behind is ultimately what gets created in our world. The reason the world is in the state it's in, is because most people do not care enough (even if they say they want things to be different) to change it through their behavior.

## The Lost Principle

The principle of Care is also referred to as the Lost Principle. This principle encapsulates all seven other principles; if you look at the seven circles that form the seed of life, the 8th added circle forms the outer shell. Without this shell present and intact, the creative (generative) essence of the seed will be lost.

# The Two Spiritual Currencies

Whatever information or endeavors we put our time and attention toward, we end up getting
something in return for that investment. This return could come in the form of knowledge,
understanding, skills, or expertise. However, this only happens if we invest our spiritual
currencies wisely. We should seek to improve the quality of our attention by directing it
towards information that is capable of improving both our own lives, as well as the human
condition as a whole.

Such an effort would constitute a valuable investment of our time. We should more frequently ask ourselves the questions:

**“What am I spending my time on?**

**What am I paying attention to?”**

And most importantly,

**“What kind of quality am I getting in return for these investments of my spiritual currencies?"**

# Natural Law Expressions

## 1. Love / Fear

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Generative Polarity is &#x2A;**Love***. In regard to Natural Law,
love should be seen as the expansive force for consciousness. Love is the force which helps us become open to truth, and expand our awareness.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the generative polarity is &#x2A;**Fear***. In regard to Natural Law, fear should be seen as the contractive force for consciousness. Fear is the force which influences us to become closed to truth, and the force which ultimately shuts down our awareness.

---

## 2. Knowledge / Ignorance

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Initiating Expression is &#x2A;**Knowledge***,or the acceptance of truth. Knowledge of truth positively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the initiating expression is &#x2A;**Ignorance***, or the refusal of truth. Ignorance negatively influences the quality of our lives because it negatively influences our decision-making processes in every area of our lives.

::note
It is important to remember that "Ignorance" should be distinguished from "Nescience". Nescience means not knowing something because necessary information is not present, or unattainable. Ignorance, on the other hand, means not knowing something even though necessary information is present, because that information has been wilfully refused or disregarded.
::

“If a nation expects to be ignorant and free, in a state of civilization, it expects what
never was and never will be.” - Thomas Jefferson, 3rd president of the U.S.A.

“The only good is knowledge, and the only evil is ignorance.”

- Socrates, Greek philosopher

---

## 3. Sovereignty / Confusion

**Positive:**:b&#x72;
The positive aspect of the Internal Expression is &#x2A;**Sovereignty***, or what is also referred to as **Internal Monarchy** (one ruler within).

The word "Monarchy" is made up of the prefix &#x2A;**Mon-**&#x2A; derived from the Greek adverb &#x2A;**Mons**&#x2A; (μόνα) which means "One, Single, or Alone" and the Greek noun &#x2A;**Archon*** (αρχων) which means "Master, Lord, or Ruler". Therefore, Monarchy means "One Ruler".

::note
As a state of consciousness, sovereignty means that one has unified the three aspects of their consciousness, in the way that there is no contradiction between one's thoughts, emotions, and actions.
::

The word "Sovereign" is derived from the Latin adverb &#x2A;**Super**&#x2A; which means "Above, or Beyond" (In classical Latin the &#x2A;**V**&#x2A; character represented a &#x2A;**U**&#x2A;, hence the letter "W" is called a "double U". The "V-sound" didn't phonetically exist in classical Latin, instead the "V" was represented by the letters "P" or "B"). The second half stems from the word &#x2A;**Regnum**&#x2A; which means "Reign, Rulership, or (externally imposed) Control, or Kingship". Thus, the word "Sovereign" means: "One who is above the rulership or control of another". Therefore, the word sovereign means "not a slave". Being sovereign means being a monarch (&#x2A;**Mon-**&#x2A;: "One", &#x2A;**Archon***: "Ruler"), a single ruler who rules only the "kingdom of self". Sovereignty is a state of being in which one controls one's own thoughts, emotions, and actions, and by bringing them into Unity, Non-Contradiction, Non-Duality, attains mastery of one's own consciousness. Self-Control is Self-Mastery is Self-Ownership.

**Negative:**:b&#x72;
The negative aspect of the internal expression is &#x2A;**Confusion***, or what is also referred to as **Internal Anarchy** (no ruler within). Confusion is the state of mind in which the being is ruled by fear and ignorance. Confusion can be seen as internal opposition, in such a way that one's thoughts, emotions, and actions are in perpetual contradiction with one another; the three are not in alignment. As we think is not how we truly feel, and is not how we act. There is complete contradiction and separation internally, when there is no unity amongst these three aspects of our consciousness.

---

## 4. Freedom / Control

**Positive:**:br
The positive aspect of the External Expression is 'Freedom,' or what is also
referred to as 'External Anarchy' (no external ruler). True freedom for all beings
should be seen as the ultimate goal of spiritual development. And such a state can only
manifest as a result of human society's adherence to Natural Law.

**Negative:**:br
The negative aspect of the external expression is 'Control,' or what is referred to as
External Monarchy (one external ruler). For example, the concentration of illusory
power by a king, or by institutions like government.
Externally imposed control is the pathway to all forms of evil and destruction. It
results when a society lives in direct opposition to Natural Law.

---

## 5. Order / Chaos

**Positive:**:br
The positive Manifestation is 'Order,' or manifested good. Order represents
everything we truly want to manifest. Order results only when there is balance and
justice; which can only be present when truth has been accepted, and our behavior
has been brought into harmony with Natural Law.

**Negative:**:br
The negative manifestation is 'Chaos,' or manifested evil. Chaos is the exact
opposite of what we truly want to manifest. Chaos occurs when there is imbalance and
injustice, which results whenever there is ignorance of truth, and behavior which is in
opposition to Natural Law.

---

description: All five expressions of Natural Law are unilateral, meaning they do not cross over into one another.

Therefore, there is no way you could accept truth and develop knowledge, and then end up in a state of confusion. Just as you cannot go from ignorance to sovereignty. The Natural Law expressions simply don't work that way.

::note
If you keep waiting on an external saviour, you are going to be waiting in your chains forever.
::

Even the modern Christ-figure himself proclaimed that the knowledge of truth would be the only pathway to true freedom. Until you take in the light, you will never dispel the darkness. The light being knowledge of truth; which is what 'light' has always symbolized and represented in the bible, and in numerous other ancient mystery traditions. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.” - John 1:5

# Right vs. Wrong

This can be explained in a way that's completely unambiguous; if you believe that there is no real difference between right and wrong, and that this concept isn't inherent in Nature, you are accepting a Satanic belief. This is because the second tenet of Satanism is the concept of "Moral Relativism" (left brain imbalance).

::todo
Insert chart
::

## The Pillars of Satanism

There are four main tenets for the ideology of Satanism, also referred to as the "Pillars of Satanism":

## 1. Self Preservation

Is the highest aspiration: If they must step on others to save themselves, they will have no problem doing so.

## 2. Moral relativism

To Satanists there is no such thing as the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. They consider 'right' to be what is 'good for me'
and 'wrong' what is 'bad for me.' And that they themselves can make up the difference between the two, based on their own personal likes and preferences.

## 3. Social Darwinism

A ruling class delegates itself the right to control and direct the masses, because they believe they know better than the rest of humanity.

## 4. Eugenics

A social ideology advocating the promotion of higher rates of sexual reproduction for people with traits and characteristics desired by its proponents - in this case Satanists - and reduced rates of sexual reproduction, or even sterilization for those with undesired traits and characteristics. The word is derived from the Greek adjective 'Eugenes (εύγενής)' which means 'Well-born / of Good stock / of Noble race.' Which is in turn derived from the Greek adjective 'Eu- (εὖ-)' which means 'Good / Well,' and the Greek noun 'Genos (γένος)' meaning 'Birth / Race / Stock.'

---

::note
Morality is not about right versus left, it's about right versus wrong.
::

::tip
A deep understanding of morality, and the principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong behavior, lies at the very heart of Natural Law.
::

Just as in ancient Rome the word &#x2A;**Liber**&#x2A; meant "Book" (Library), and "Free" (Liberty) simultaneously. The word &#x2A;**Right**&#x2A; means "Correct" and "Moral" simultaneously, as does &#x2A;**Wrong*** mean "Incorrect" and "Immoral" simultaneously.

## What a Right Is

So, in the sense of what you "have a right to do", what is a right?

A right is any action in which you are correct and moral in doing so. Every single person has the same rights as the next; not one person has any more rights than another, nor any less rights, at any place, at any time.

# Knowing Rights

This process helps us to understand what a right actually is, by understanding which actions are not rights because they cause harm to other sentient beings.

The word &#x2A;**Apophasis**&#x2A; is derived from the Greek noun &#x2A;**Apophanai*** (απόφασις) which means "to Speak off". This is a method of logical, deductive reasoning, that is employed when given a limited set of possibilities, in which we gain knowledge about something by excluding the known negatives, or by setting the logical inconsistencies to the side.

In other words, describing what something is, by explaining what it is not.

# Natural Law Transgressions

## Murder & Assault

Ending a life without the right to do so. If a being is killed in the act of somebody defending themselves, it is not murder.
Under no possible circumstance does the “right to murder” or the “right to assault” exist. However, the right to defend oneself through physical force exists at all times.

## Rape

Coercing the free will of another person, and making them sexually associate with whom they wish not to.

## Theft

Taking what somebody else has created or acquired through lawful means, which is their property for as long as they are using it and being responsible for it. You have no right to just take something that does not belong to you.

## Trespass

Every person has the right to set aside a (reasonably sized) space for themselves. And invading this area without permission or consent would be invading their privacy and their personal space, while taking away their security in the process.

## Coercion

Forcing somebody through threat of violence to have their will comply with yours, whether they wish that to be the case or not. Making somebody do something against their will is not a right. Although this is already a short and seemingly simple list, all these transgressions can ultimately be narrowed down to just one wrong-doing: Theft.

::note
Every harmful action that a person is capable of taking is a form of theft. Some form of property is always being stolen when a wrong-doing is committed.
::

---

## Property Types

- Life is a form of property.
- Rights are a form of property.
- Freedom is a form of property.
- A person's own body is a form of property.

## No Victim, No Crime

A living being or their property must have been harmed or damaged in order for a violation of Natural Law, or a wrong-doing to have taken place. Any action which does not cause such harm to other sentient beings is a right. - No victim, no crime. This is the fundamental crux of Natural Law; what is right behavior, and what is wrong behavior.

## No Delegation

There is no such thing as the delegation of a wrong-doing. In other words, if a specific action is not a right for any individual, then that action cannot be "delegated", "granted", or "licensed" to any other individual, or group of individuals, and suddenly be called a right. That action forever remains wrong under Natural Law.

::tip
Rights can't be granted to human beings by other human beings, because rights don't come from human beings.
::

## Equal Rights

Everybody is born with the exact same rights. Natural Law (the difference between right and wrong behavior) always holds true regardless of a population's belief systems (culture). This means that it doesn't matter how many people agree that a wrong action can be turned into a right action, or that a right action can be turned into a wrong action.

Such things can never be done in reality. People can only believe they can claim such reversals and that this will in some way make it so. Unfortunately, at this moment in time most people do erroneously believe that it is morally possible for some groups of people to create and delegate "rights" which do not exist, or to take away rights which do exist.

## A World with Only Two People

When in doubt as to whether an action is, or is not in harmony with Natural Law, visualize the scenario of a world with only two people.

If the behavior is a right or a wrong in that instance, it shall forever remain a right or a wrong in any size population, regardless of how many people may believe otherwise. So, if the action is a right for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a right. And if the action is a wrong for one person to do toward another, it shall always remain a wrong, regardless of the number of people involved.

## What Taxation Really Is

Taxation is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given or delegated the "right" to (forcibly) confiscate an arbitrarily chosen percentage of the product of another individual's labour (a form of property), whether or not that person agrees to share that product voluntarily (coercion is involved).

## Enforced by Threats

Taxation is enforced by the following threats:

1. **Theft** - Seizing property that is rightfully a person's possession.
2. **Imprisonment** - Taking away the physical freedom of movement.
3. **Violence** - Behavior resulting in bodily harm, if those from whom the product is being seized attempt to resist the confiscation.

::note
These practices is always "justified" by those who claim that such practices are necessary and required to uphold the common good.
::

## Justification

The word "Justified" etymologically derives from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Jus**&#x2A; or &#x2A;**Juris**&#x2A; which mean "Right, Law", and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Facere*** which means "to Create, or to Make". Therefore, "to Justify" etymologically means "to Create right, to Create law."

## Involuntary Confiscation

If we define the concept of slavery as: the involuntary confiscation of 100% of the product of labour of another person, we can clearly see that there is no percentage to which we could lower this number (other than 0%) that would no longer constitute slavery. Many people try to justify this by saying this money is used for different services. However, we aren't able to refuse most of these "services".

Imagine, you have a computer at home; one day a computer technician knocks on your door and tells you: "I am now your computer technician, and you are not allowed to refuse my services." Immediately the right to choose (free will) has been taken away from you. Then he tells you "Whether you want or don't want my technician services, I'm going to need $300, every year, and I'll come over every two months to collect my money. I do not care if you are happy with my service or not, and if you refuse to pay me, I will take your computer."

## Duress

Does it seem like the computer is truly yours, if you are living under that kind of coercion? Or does it seem more like a violent criminal telling you: "I am going to steal your possessions if you don't give me what I tell you to." That sounds more like a form of extortion or duress, and that is what all forms of taxation fall under.

## Taxation Is Slavery

If we are being completely honest with ourselves, taxation is merely a euphemism for theft, violence, and slavery; these are the three practices on which it is actually truly based. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim ownership of the product of another person's labour, such behavior can never be delegated to a group of people, and called a "right." Therefore:

::note
All forms of taxation are always wrong according to Natural Law.
::

## Prohibition

Another important example of something to examine for what it actually truly is, is Prohibition. Whether regarding drugs or junk-food, ingesting anything harmful into the body is strongly opposed, hopefully for obvious reasons; purification of the body is an important part of purification of the mind.

description: It is crucial to recognize that anyone should be allowed to put anything inside their body, because they own their body.

If an individual, for whatever reason, wants to ingest any given substance they always have the right to do so; because their body is their property. People easily tend to overthink the concept when confronted with the question whether their body is theirs or not. They often pause and ask themselves questions like: "Am I going to own my body forever? I'm going to die someday, does that mean I don't own it now?" This is a complete over-mystification of the concept.

All sensible people recognize that they will die someday, and that their consciousness will then leave their bodies. Does that mean they don't own their body right now? Your consciousness inhabits (lives, exists inside) your body, which is one of the specific reasons you own your body, the other is that you are using your body right now. Specifically, because your conscious inhabits your body, and you are using it as the vehicle for the expression of your consciousness. Your body is yours.

Continuing on the topic of Prohibition, it is the claim that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent others from putting any given substance into their own bodies, and if those people refuse to comply with those terms, they will be fined or imprisoned. It should be self-evident that since an individual's body is their own property, that individual always maintains the natural right to decide what will or will not be put into their own property. In this instance, their own body.

Imagine another person telling you that you aren't allowed to put your jacket into your car, or that you can't put a certain piece of furniture inside your home. Why is it that most people would not accept that, but do accept this concept regarding their own body? - Because people can't seem to separate the act of imbibing the substance, and the action that someone may subsequently take, which are two different things.

A person may have some drinks, and get drunk if they wish to; but if that person goes out on the street afterwards and starts beating somebody up for no reason, they obviously have no right to do that. However, an individual
maintains the right to go drinking, or use cocaine, or even inject heroine into their arm. They obviously aren't good ideas, but every individual has the right to do so if they please; as long as their subsequent behavior isn't immoral and wrong. And if it is, they are still fully accountable for the actions they took, that's what personal responsibility is.

The two separate acts of a person having the right to put whatever they want into their own body, and still being personally responsible for whatever he or she may do with their body afterwards, need to be clearly delineated, and separated from one another.

description: Understanding this, we can easily see that the claim of "right" to dictate what will or will not be put into the body of another person amounts to a claim of ownership upon the other person's body.

Imagine somebody telling you that you aren't allowed to eat carrots or drink orange juice for example. The claim of ownership upon another person's body is slavery. Therefore, prohibition is merely a euphemism for slavery, backed by violence, regardless of the justifications made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's body, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

::tip
All forms of prohibition are always wrong according to Natural Law.
::

## Licenses & Permits

Lastly, we will examine Licenses and Permits, keep in mind to also visualize the same scenario with only two people as was mentioned before. In that sense, most people can readily see that no single person, or group of people is able to legitimately make these claims towards another person; regarding taxation, prohibition, licenses and permits.

We have gotten to the point where most people actually believe that certain groups of people have created rights for themselves that other people don't have. Licenses and permits are claims that a group of people who call themselves "Government" have been given the "right" to prevent other people from exercising specific behaviors, even if such behaviors cause no harm to others, or their property.

Unless those people [petition](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#petition), or pay the government for permission (where the word "permit" is derived from) to be allowed to exercise those behaviors. This amounts to the claim that rights are merely privileges that may be granted or taken away by government at any time, based upon the people in government's preference or discretion.

Remembering that the definition of a [right](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#right) is: "any action which does not cause harm to another sentient being or their property". It can be readily seen that there is no such thing as the "right" to stop someone from exercising a right, since rights cause no harm.

The claim over the rights of another person is called slavery, regardless of the justification made by those who claim such practices are necessary to uphold the common good. Since no individual anywhere on Earth has the right to claim the ownership of another person's rights, such behavior can never be delegated to a group, and called a right. Therefore:

::tip
All forms of licensing and permits are always wrong according to Natural Law

# Force vs. Violence

## Force

**The capacity to do work or cause physical change.** For any change to be created in the physical world in any capacity, physical force must be applied. There is nothing you can do to change something in the physical world, that doesn't require force. The words you are reading right now were typed out by hand using physical force.

::tip
Force is the capacity to perform physical work, physical change.
::

**Action which is in harmony with morality and Natural Law because it does not violate others' rights.** As soon as a person steps over that line, and uses initiation of force for coercive reasons or applications, that is what makes it violence instead of force. Force itself is not the same as violence.

**Action which one always possesses the right to take (including defense against violence).** When you are approached with violence you reserve the right to use physical force defensively against such an assault.

## Violence

**The immoral initiation of physical power to coerce, compel or restrain.** [Initiation](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/en/reference/glossary#initiation) is the key-word here. Nobody ever has the right to enact violence; because violence is always starting the conflict.

::note
The immoral initiation of force is violence.
::

For example, what often happens in primary schools when two students get into a physical altercation, the teachers usually tend to say: "It doesn't matter who started it". While that is one of the absolute most critically important things that matters. Because the person that struck first, is the person that conducted violence, they initiated the immoral use of physical force.

**Coercive action which is in opposition to morality and Natural Law because it involves the violation of others' rights.*&#x2A; This is exactly why it's called violence; it violates the rights of other people. The act of violating rights is what violence is, it's derived from the same root word, the Latin verb &#x2A;**Violare***, which means "to Treat with violence or dishonor".

**Action which one never possesses the right to take.** There exists no such thing as the right to commit violence. However, one always reserves the right to use force in a defensive capacity, up to, and including deadly force.

# The Two Pillars of Enlightenment

## The Sacred Feminine

The first pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Feminine principle", also called the **Non-Aggression Principle**. This principle states:

::tip
Do not engage in violence. In other words, do not immorally initiate non-rightful use of physical force to coerce, constrain, or compel the rightful behavior, or free will choice of another sentient being.
::

## The Sacred Masculine

The second pillar of enlightenment is the "Sacred Masculine principle", also called the **Self-Defense Principle**. This principle states:

::tip
Sentient beings have the inherent right to use force to defend themselves and others from violence conducted against them.

# Ownership

## Ownership Meaning

To own something means that, regarding that thing, an individual maintains:

1. Rightful possession (acquired without doing somebody else harm)
2. Control of usage
3. Maintaining personal responsibility.

::tip
Natural Law can essentially be reduced to a single spiritual law: 

**Do Not Steal**

.
::

## All Rights Are Property Rights

We have to collectively understand that all rights are property rights. Stop taking the property of other beings, and stop condoning the taking of property of other beings.

# Conscience

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Conscience**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin prefix &#x2A;**Con-**&#x2A; which means "Together, or with" and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Scire*** which means "to Know, or to Understand". Those two words combined mean "to Know together". Therefore:

::tip
Conscience is common sense, quite literally. All of us together must come to an understanding of the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong behavior according to Natural Law.
::

## Exercise of Conscience (Action)

The exercise of conscience is the free will choice of right action over wrong action; once the definitive knowledge of the objective difference between right and wrong according to Natural Law has been acquired and integrated into the being. We must acquire that knowledge first, come to an understanding of it, and finally we act either in accordance with it, or in disharmony with it. If we act in accordance with it, that is called the exercise of conscience.

# The Law of Freedom

::tip
As morality increases, freedom increases. As morality declines, freedom declines.
::

## Inverse Proportions

Another way of stating this law would be to say that the presence of truth and morality in the lives of people in any given society, is inversely proportional to the presence of tyranny and slavery in that society. The more knowledge of truth and morality there is, the less tyranny and slavery there will be within that society.

## True Freedom

True freedom can never exist in a society that embraces Moral Relativism, the idea that there is no inherent and objective difference between right and wrong, thinking that humanity may arbitrarily “create” or “decide” right and wrong for themselves.

# Natural Law vs. Mans Law

## Natural Law

**Based upon principles & truth**. :br
Inherent to creation. Things that are inherent to creation are not made or caused by humankind.

**Harmonized with, due to knowledge & understanding. (or rejected, due to ignorance or contradicting beliefs).**:br
Natural Law isn't something that's based on a person's compliance, because that person has to fear the “punishment” of not understanding it. If you don't understand it, and don't live according to it, the result or consequence will be inescapable.

::tip
If you behave a certain way, there are certain consequences. And if you change your
behavior, you'll change the consequential results.
::

### Universal

Exists and applies anywhere in the universe regardless of location. There is no place you can go in the physical universe where Natural Law doesn't apply.

### Eternal and immutable.

Exists and applies for as long as the universe exists, and cannot be changed. Natural Law is immutable because it cannot be changed by any action that any being in the universe is capable of taking.

---

## Man's Law (Government)

### Dogmatic

Based upon dogmatic beliefs. (Constructs of mind). These beliefs can be seen as “programs” operating in the human mind.

### Fear Based

Complied with due to fear of punishment. Fear is usually the only reason people ever comply with the law of man; and fear is an extremely low state of consciousness.

### Location Based Moral Relativism

Differs with location based upon the whim of legislators. For example, prohibition; you are "allowed" to smoke marijuana in certain countries, but could be jailed for doing the exact same thing in another country where it's deemed "illegal".

### Time Based Moral Relativism

Changes with time based upon the whim of legislators. To use prohibition as an example again; from 1920 until 1933, it was made illegal to possess, and to consume alcohol in the United States of America. Before 1920 it was legal, and after 1933 it was made legal again, all because of what some politicians wrote on pieces of paper.

For man's law this means; if a particular man-made law is in harmony with Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is redundant, since it is stating a truth that is pre-existing and inherent in Nature. Therefore, the writing down of that concept and calling it a law, is both unnecessary and irrelevant.

If a particular man-made law is in opposition to Natural Law, then it follows logically that it is both false (incorrect) and immoral (harmful to others), more simply put, it's wrong. Because if it isn't based in Natural Law it means that it is causing somebody harm by taking something that belongs to them, whether it's a right, or any physical possession. Therefore, it can never be legitimately binding upon anyone. Somebody can't write down a wrong-doing and tell you that it is morally binding upon you, while simultaneously literally stating that even though it causes harm, you must obey this rule.

::tip
In light and presence of Natural Law, man's “law” is always unnecessary and irrelevant.

# Equality Under Natural Law

## Not Granted or Gifted

Since rights are not created by humanity, and since they are the birth-right of humanity, gifted to us by the Creator of the universe. Not a single person or group of people is capable of "granting" or "gifting" rights to anyone else, nor is any person capable of revoking rights from anyone else. Including Governments.

## What Government Really Is

The word &#x2A;**Government**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Gubernare**&#x2A; which means "to Control, to Rule, or to Direct". (just as was shown earlier with the etymological breakdown of the word "Sovereign", there is no "V sound" in classical Latin. This can be readily seen in the name of the ceremony for electing a governor; they are called &#x2A;**Gubernatorial**&#x2A; elections.) The second part of the word "Government" is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Mens**&#x2A; which means &#x2A;**Mind***. Therefore, put together the word "Govern-ment" etymologically means "Mind Control".

::note
Government is Mind Control
::

The etymological origin of the English suffix &#x2A;**-ment**&#x2A; is often debated, yet it is quite clear that those who created the English language deliberately chose &#x2A;**Mens**&#x2A; the Latin word for &#x2A;**Mind***, to mean "the State of-" or "the Condition of-", in direct keeping with the first Hermetic principle, the principle of Mentalism. Which demonstrates that in order for any particular event, circumstance, state or condition to exist in our current manifested reality (the plane of effects), it must first have existed in the mind (the plane of causality).

## The Illusion of Authority

Government is based on the illusory concept called "Authority". People that believe certain other people are authorities, means they believe that those individuals have rights that other people do not. Mainly, the rights to command, compel, coerce and constrain.

Authority is based upon an equally illusory concept called "Jurisdiction". The word
&#x2A;**Jurisdiction**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Jus**&#x2A; or &#x2A;**Juris**&#x2A; which means "Right, or Law", and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Dictere*** which means "to Speak, or to Say". Thus, the word "Jurisdiction" literally means "to Say what the law is". In other words, to "make up" or to "decide" what the law is.

"Authority" is an illusion of a diseased psyche, based entirely in violence and built upon the false belief that some people are "masters" who have the moral right to issue commands, and that other people have a moral obligation to obey those commands. Simply put, slavery.

::note
The belief in the legitimacy of "Authority" is the belief in the legitimacy of Slavery.
::

description: Ultimately, "Authority" is the idea that man can become God, and through jurisdiction, dictate the law, and dictate what is right and wrong.

The concept of government and the concept of authority are forms of (false) religion, yet most people fail to see it that way. The word &#x2A;**Religion**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Religare*** which means "to Tie back, to Hold back, to Thwart from forward progress, or to Bind.'

A false religion is a system of control based in unchallenged, dogmatic belief which holds back the progress of consciousness.

::tip
We should stop trying to make our religion truth, and start making truth our religion.
::

## The One True Divide

There is only one true divide that separates humanity into two distinct types of individuals. The criterion for this divide is whether or not a person believes in “authority,” and therefore believes that there is legitimacy to slavery. That is the only divide which truly separates us.

# Statism vs. Anarchy

## Statism

A Statist is a person who erroneously believes that there is such a thing as “authority” vested in certain people, giving them the “right” to rule over others. This “authority” means that certain people, who call themselves 'government,' have the moral right to issue commands to those whom they rule (those under their jurisdiction), and that their subjects (slaves) have a “moral obligation” to obey the arbitrary dictates (laws) set by their “masters.”

::note
Most simply put, a statist is someone who believes in the legitimacy of slavery.
::

## Anarchy

Conversely, an Anarchist is a person that knows there could never be legitimacy to “authority” or “government” because those terms are simply euphemisms for violence and slavery, which are always immoral and in opposition to Natural Law.

The word &#x2A;**Anarchy**&#x2A; is derived from the Greek prefix &#x2A;**An-**&#x2A; (αν-) which means "Without, or the Absence of" and the Greek noun &#x2A;**Archon*** (αρχων)' which means "Master, or Ruler". Anarchy does not mean "Without rules". It literally means "Without Rulers, or Without Masters".

The only permanent rules that are in place, are the ones of Natural Law.

::note
No Masters = No Slaves
::

It seems self-evident that &#x2A;**Anarchy*** is the true meaning of freedom, and yet, when you ask a person what anarchy means (to them), and what they associate it with, the answer will most likely be: rioting, looting and destroying other people's property, in one word; chaos. Which is literally the exact opposite of what anarchy truly is.

# The Fear of Chaos

::pictures

  ![Hand on a stove](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/img/content/33-hand-stove.jpg){.rounded-lg.w-full height="300" width="1000"}
  :::
::

## Do Not Burn Yourself

What you see pictured above is obviously a bad idea and you probably shouldn't do that; if your desire is not to burn your hand up to the point of blistering and your skin coming off. But if you don't care about that happening, then by all means, keep your hand right on that burner. However, if you wish not to get burned, there are certain requirements for obtaining that condition. That means you can't keep your hand on something that is extremely hot, or Natural Law will take over and burn your hand.

In our current human condition it seems that a lot of people would say they do not want to be burned, yet simultaneously, they insist: “No, I want to put my hand on the burner while the range is switched on, and NOT be burned!” But obviously, it doesn't work that way.

If you don't want to be burned, your hand can't be kept there while the stove is on; if you don't want self-inflicted suffering and chaos in your life, you've got to align your behavior to Natural Law. Which means you've got to know the objective difference between right and wrong behavior, and through free will choice deliberately choose right action over wrong action. And only then, will you not get burnt.

::tip
True freedom includes infinite possibility, which, by definition, includes the possibility of chaos. This possibility must be embraced without fear if we are to be truly free.
::

## The Fear of True Freedom

For real freedom to exist, we must accept that in the physical world there are risks, and there could be dangers. There will always be the possibility of something unexpected happening, something going wrong, or someone getting hurt; but if you are living in that state of fear, you are living in a very low state of consciousness.

Fear ultimately leads to chaos. The fear of chaos itself can only get you more chaos, because it is based in fear (see 'Natural Law expressions' chart). The fear of the possibility of chaos is the fear of true freedom. This can also symbolically be seen as the “death” of the imagination.

## Imagination

Imagination is the powerful ability of the human mind to envision a different state or condition than the one that is already manifested. Imagination must be present in order to create a different state of existence than the one currently being experienced. This is because, according to the principle of mentalism, for a different state to manifest in the physical world (plane of effects), it must first exist within the mind (plane of causality).

::caution
If the imagination is stifled or destroyed, creating any positive change to our state of existence becomes completely impossible.
::

Through their fear of the possibility of chaos (true freedom), most people advocate the
legitimacy and continuance of “authority” and government, and are therefore actually
advocating the legitimacy and continuance of violence and slavery.

Those who believe that “authority” is necessary and that it must continue, have been duped into believing that human slavery is necessary and must continue in order to prevent chaos.

::tip
Violence and slavery cannot prevent chaos. Violence and slavery are chaos.

# Order Followers

Not the ruling class, not the political "leader", or "masters", and not the so-called "elite", The people that keep the current slavery system in place, are the people who wilfully follow orders. Which can be a difficult truth to learn, and to accept for a lot of people.

## Following Orders

Following orders means doing what you are told to do, without judging for yourself whether or not the action you are being ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

If an individual is following orders, that individual can impossibly be exercising conscience, because by definition, exercising conscience means that one is wilfully choosing for themselves right action over wrong action.

Following orders should never be seen as a virtue of any kind; if you are acting based solely on what someone has told you to do, there is no morality found in that, whatsoever. There is no such thing as morally following orders, the two terms are contradictory.

Therefore, "I was just following order", is never a valid excuse or justification for immoral, harmful behavior. This sorry attempt to give up personal responsibility should never be accepted as a valid excuse for such behavior.

## Unconscious Behavior

The order-follower tries to abdicate their personal responsibility for their actions and pretend the blame lies with the order giver; which is an obvious lie (to themselves, mainly). They could look you dead in the eye and say "I'm not responsible for that. I just did it; but I'm not the person who's responsible for it, because I was acting on orders from somebody else",

It's astonishing that they somehow truly seem to believe that statement can be regarded as true, in any way. Sadly, lots of people nowadays believe that there is legitimacy to this immoral behavior because a group of people calling themselves 'government' have somehow been imbued and gifted with such "rights",

The people in government believe they have rights that others don't; but what's even worse is that the people who are actually affected by their immoral behavior, they believe it too.

> "You assist an evil system most effectively by obeying its orders and decrees. An evil system never deserves such allegiance. Allegiance to it means partaking of the evil. A good person will resist an evil system with his or her whole soul"

# Moral Culpability

## Definition

Moral culpability is the determination of who is ultimately at fault, or deserving of blame for
the commission of actions which resulted in harm or loss for others.

## Etymology

The word &#x2A;**Culpable**&#x2A; means "at Fault, or Deserving of blame", it is derived from the Latin noun &#x2A;**Culpa*** which means "Fault, or Blame".

::note
The people that act out a certain behavior and cause harm, loss, chaos or trauma to others
always carry blame.
::

**Who actually carried out the holocaust in Germany?**:br
The people that followed the orders to do so; therefore, order-followers is the answer. And they are always in the form of police or military; this is why a totalitarian state is referred to as a "Police State." Because they are the people ultimately responsible for bringing that condition into manifestation through their behavior.

## Police State

The order giver (president, mayor, judge etc.) makes a command, the order-follower obeys without question, and through their behavior make that condition a reality; that"s why it"s called a police state. Because every police state that has ever existed, has
always been created by police following orders. Because they don't want to think for themselves, they don't want the personal responsibility and they don't want to truly know the difference between right and wrong for themselves, like a responsible adult person would.

::todo
Insert Figure
::

Note that the term "MORE" is underlined and capitalized; the order givers are also morally culpable, that is not the question. The question is “Who is MORE morally culpable?” The answer is always the order-follower, at any time, in any place.

The people on the left aren't the actual cause of what happened on the picture in the middle; all they did was sign some pieces of paper, and told the people on the right: “Go and bomb/shoot/kill these people” and they said “Yes, sir” and went right ahead and committed whatever wrong-doings they were commanded, without questioning at all if what they had been ordered to carry out is right or wrong behavior.

::todo
Insert Figure
::

The order-follower always bears more moral culpability that the order-giver, because the order-follower is the one who actually performed the action, and in taking such action, brought the resulting harm into physical manifestation. Order-following is the pathway to every form of evil and chaos in our world. Again, it should never be seen as a virtue by anyone who considers themselves a moral person. Order-followers have ultimately been personally responsible and morally culpable for every form of slavery and every single totalitarian regime that has ever existed.

# Responsibility vs. Abdication

## Responsibility

An individual's personal responsibility to choose right action over wrong action for themselves is always their own. One can only (falsely) claim that they are abdicating personal responsibility for such choice to someone else, it can never actually be done in reality. It's merely a claim when an order-follower says, “I am not personally responsible, because this person told me to do it” and what it actually truly is, is just a lie. More simply put...

::note
Every individual is 

**always responsible**

 for their own actions
::

> “Accept responsibility for yourself and your actions, thoughts, and words. You alone make choices. You alone are answerable to the consequences of your behavior. The feeble excuse that your boss required it, or the establishment expected it, holds no truth or justification.” :br*David Icke, English Author*

Lots of people erroneously believe that they can hand over their Natural Law right to defend themselves to another individual, or entity. In making such a false claim, they have attempted to abdicate a responsibility which always belongs to them, and can't be wholly given away.

# Self Loathing vs. Self Respect

::note
The states of Self Loathing and Self Respect cannot exist simultaneously, for they are contradictory psychological conditions.
::

## Self Loathing

Self-loathing is the underlying psychological condition that causes people to attempt to abdicate their own personal responsibility to exercise conscience, and fall into patterns of order-following and justification. Just as it is not possible for an order-follower to truly be exercising conscience; it is also not possible for an order-follower to truly love themselves.

Self-loathing is created when an earlier trauma has been buried into the subconscious mind, instead of being confronted, dealt with, and healed. Such trauma could form feelings of inadequacy; whether they are real, suggested, or simply imagined. A mind-set as such is a psychological prison, and yet, people suffering from self-loathing
usually don't seem to have any desire for true freedom - &#x2A;*They are in the cage, and they love being in the cage.**

::tip
The only kind of people that have no desire for real freedom, are people in the psychological state of self-loathing, that do not love themselves.
::

## Self Respect

Self-respect heals self-loathing. It is about introspection (observation or examination of one's own conscious thoughts and emotional state).

The word &#x2A;**Respect**&#x2A; is derived from the Latin prefix &#x2A;**Re-**&#x2A; which means "Again" and the Latin verb &#x2A;**Spectare*** which means "to Look at, or to Take another look at oneself". This is where true respect starts.

You cannot give somebody something that you don't already own yourself. If you don't have $10,- in your pocket you could impossibly give it to someone else. You must obtain it first, before you can give it away. Therefore, nobody can give respect to anybody else unless they first developed it inwardly.

Self-respect must come first, which is why people in the state of self-loathing don't respect anybody, least of all themselves. Only self-respect can heal self-loathing, and therefore help put an order-follower on the path to exercising conscience.

# The Lost Word

## Balanced Consciousness

In order to speak the lost word, a person must work upon themselves in order to achieve a state of equilibrium (balance) between the left and right brain hemispheres.

In such a state of balanced consciousness, the individual has come to know the self (microcosm), as well as the working operations of Natural Law (macrocosm), and in doing so has come to understand the objective difference between right and wrong behavior. Or as they are referred to in Freemasonry, "**Light** (Knowledge)" and "**Darkness** (Ignorance)".

## The Word of All Power

In the balanced state of consciousness generated through the knowledge of Natural Law, a person is finally able to speak the lost word, which is - "**No**".

In Freemasonry it is considered to be the word of all power. When we say no to those who claim to be our owners, those who claim that they will decide which rights we have or do not have, only then do we stop externalizing our power to anyone outside of ourselves and in doing so, reclaim all of our
rights (all of our property). Sadly, very few people in our world have the **knowledge, care, and courage** that is required to do this. That is why this powerful word is considered to be "lost".

## Know your Rights

The reason you have to know what the difference between right and wrong is, and therefore know what rights you have and which you do not have, is because those who don't know, won't say no (to somebody who claims to be their owner).

# Teaching Natural Law to Others

::tip
Knowledge is the only solution; and the propagation of that knowledge is Education.
::

## Education

The word &#x2A;**Education**&#x2A; derives from the Latin verb &#x2A;**Educere*** means "to Take, to Draw, or to Lead out from". Leading a person out of darkness (ignorance) is what a real teacher does.

Rather than “pushing” a person out of that darkness, the teacher will go first and show that person the way, and if he or she feels it is the accurate path, that person can follow the same discovery process.

::note
This education process must be a repeatable process; as was mentioned earlier, Natural Law isn't a religion or a belief system, it is a science.

# Shift Happens

## Quantum Shift

A 'Quantum Shift' in human consciousness is required for humanity to become free of its self-imposed state of slavery.

Unfortunately, this great change is not an automatic process, nor is it guaranteed to happen at all. Anybody who thinks that's the case is very naïve, overly positive, and in some form of right-brain imbalance. Whether or not this shift will occur mainly relies on the human will to learn the truth and teach it to others. This involves enormous effort, dedication, and persistence. We cannot give up.

There is a saying in Alchemy that has been referred to as the "catchphrase of the alchemical tradition", the saying goes: &#x2A;**Labore et constantia*** which means "Work and constancy". Constant effort is going to be required to get this boulder up the mountain, and in the condition in which humanity finds itself today, it will most likely go kicking and screaming.

Teaching Natural Law to others is not an easy task, it usually isn't fun, and we're definitely not going to get it done in a day. Therefore, we are going to have to continually work hard on this matter, or the quantum shift simply will not happen at all.

## Requirements

A Quantum Shift Has Requirements. The word quantum is derived from the (same) Latin noun &#x2A;**Quantum*** which means "Amount". In order to tip the scales of truth and justice back into balance, a certain amount of people actually need to be doing the Great Work of helping other people to receive this knowledge of Natural Law. Simply put, higher amounts of people are required.

Individual behavioral choices, either based in harmony or in opposition to Natural Law, combine in energy and effect, and in the aggregate, influence the quality of the manifested shared human experience; we collectively create our shared experience. This dynamic acts as a perfect expression of the principle of Correspondence: "As above, so below; as below, so above." Decisively contrary to the "New age" view.

::note
In order for a quantum shift to happen, higher numbers of people are required.

# The Great Work

## Internal Alignment

From that moment on, the teaching of the Great Work can begin; because once that has been done, there is no more internal contradiction or opposition within that person. From there on out, you can legitimately start teaching it to other people because you know it deeply enough, and have truly aligned your behavior to it. The Great Work is what comes next.

::note
The Great Work is the arduous task of influencing other people to go through that same process of positive change, that you have gone through yourself.
::

It is to help them realize that in supporting and condoning the legitimacy of "authority" and "government (man's law)," they have actually been supporting and condoning the legitimacy of slavery. And that they were immoral for having done so; convincing a person of that is hard work. Because people usually don't want to hear this, they want what they think is true, to be true.

What the Great Work comes down to is to get people to abandon their (false) religions The false and dogmatic beliefs which hold back the progress of consciousness by impeding the reception of knowledge of Natural Law.

> "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious. The latter procedure, however, is disagreeable, and therefore, not popular."
> *Carl Gustav Jung, Swiss psychotherapist*

The true Great Work is to become a teacher of Natural Law; and as the old saying goes 'many hands make light work.'

> "Educate and inform the whole mass of the people. That is the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty."
> &#x2A;Thomas Jefferson, 3rd President of the U.S.A.*

> "In every declining civilization there is a small remnant of people who adhere to the right against the wrong; who recognize the difference between good and evil and who will take an active stand for the former and against the latter; who can still think and discern, and who will courageously take a stand against the political, social, moral, and spiritual decay of their day." - excerpt from the book 'Toward a New World Order' by
> &#x2A;Donald S. McAlvany, Author, "Toward a New World Order"*

The words that are attributed to Jesus Christ in the Gospel of Matthew:

> "Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the Earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. A man's enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me. Anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it."
> &#x2A;Jesus Christ, (Matthew 10:34-39)*

If you imagine that these words were in some way "spoken" by the truth instead of Jesus Christ. It's telling you that there will be people in your own family who will not align themselves with right over wrong behavior, they will continue to choose, and to advocate violence and slavery. These are not people you want to continue to align yourself with, if you have truly made an effort to explain what is really taking place.

## What will this battle really be against?

The personal "battle" that must take place will be against the inner demons which exist within the psyche of humankind, namely:

- Egos hardened into "negative knowledge"
- Emotional mind control
- Fear of true freedom

## "Negative Knowledge"

The greatest enemy may not be ignorance, but rather the illusion of knowledge. When a person dismisses information simply because they think they already know it, or think it isn't important. Not only are they not at the starting point for truth discovery; because they are already attached to information
that isn't true. They are put in a negative starting position because they must first unlearn the information they have been conditioned to believe, to even get to the actual starting point. This happens when a person is in left-brain imbalance.

## Emotional Mind Control

"If it's unpleasant, I don't want to hear it, I don't want to see it, and I certainly don't want to tell others about it! I'll just ignore it, and it will go away." What happens when you would do that with, for example, an illness, or any other problem? It doesn't tend to get better, it only gets worse.

Another form of emotional mind control is when a person dismisses information solely because that person dislikes the way the information is being presented, or delivered to them. You cannot determine the veracity of informational content based on how it makes you feel, doing so is a logical fallacy; you cannot "think" with the emotions. While emotions are also extremely important (our "compass" for morality), you can't thoroughly analyze and conclude what's true based only on how something makes you feel. If you are told a lie in a sweet, pleasant and soothing voice, it's still a lie. If you are told a truth in an abrasive, harsh and scratchy voice, it is still truth.

> "Truth is belligerent. Truth is, by its very nature, at war with the forces of falsehood and deceit."
> *Bertolt Brecht, German Poet*

## Fear of True Freedom

The fear of true freedom come from self-loathing due to lack of self-respect (heart of the problem) and from the refusal to own personal responsibility (symptom of the problem).

People that are psychologically, emotionally, and spiritually immature, people who haven't grown up and young children are the kind of people who want to live in perpetual refusal to their personal responsibility (something that is regarded a hallmark of true adulthood and maturity), because they have nested traumatic issues that have led to self-loathing and lack of self-respect.

Until we start to figure out the causal factors of the other manifesting psychological conditions listed above, we are merely dealing with the symptoms, not the root of the problem. If a child doesn't like itself, and they feel they are "not good enough" or "not worthy," all these imagined feelings of inadequacy, and self-loathing. Those are usually the factors that cause their refusal to grow up, and their refusal to take personal responsibility for their actions during adulthood.

::note
Abandonment is the specific type of childhood trauma they have gone through and the root of the fear of true freedom.
::

description: The human species is suffering from very deep-seated parental abandonment issues, that lie at the very core of our global psychological condition; the human condition. Until we deal with that deeply nested psychological trauma, we aren't dealing with the actual root cause of the problem, and we won't get any closer to solving it.

---

## Requirements

**What will be required on the part of those performing the Great Work?**

- Knowledge of the real enemy
- Service to truth
- Courage and persistence
- Practical real-world skills

## Knowledge of The Real Enemy

The real enemy is the ignorant masses. There are people that say: "The Illuminati enslaves humanity." Which is not at all the case; humanity enslaves the real Illuminati (the 'Illuminated (enlightened)' ones). If that term is to be used for anyone, it makes more sense to apply it to actual teachers of Natural Law, the people that know and understand what is written about in this guide are the real "Illuminati." - They are the real "enlightened" ones; the ones with the light, the ones with the knowledge of Natural Law.

::note
Humanity is enslaving itself, and also the true Illuminati: the teachers that are actually living under the conditions of slavery because they are here with the ignorant masses.
::

It almost seems as if people prefer to think: "we're powerless victims, there is no choice involved here, this is something that is just being done to us." While free will is always in existence, and it's a matter of changing one's thoughts, and therefore changing one's choices. And that is our own personal responsibility which can never be given away. Once more, &#x2A;*you are always responsible for your own actions.**

## Service to Truth

Truth can never be destroyed. But humanity can definitely be destroyed, if we refuse to act in service to truth as its defenders. There are people that think truth doesn't need to be defended, which is simply not true. Truth needs to be fended for at all times and places, because the attack on it is never-ending and non-
stop. If we do not come to defend truth; the voice of untruth and deception rules the day, and the voice of truth will not be heard. Since the truth doesn't have its own voice in our physical domain, we must act as its mediums and literally be its voice, if we desire true freedom.

It is definitely possible for us to co-create a positive outcome, but this can only be accomplished if we care enough to learn the truth ourselves, and then develop the courage to speak it to other people.

> "If you love wealth greater than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude greater than the animating contest for freedom, go home from us in peace. We seek not your counsel, nor your arms. Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you. May your chains set lightly upon you, and may posterity forget you were our countrymen."
> &#x2A;Samuel Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the U.S.A.*

## Persistence

We are the vehicles by which truth operates in our world. Therefore, it is our shared responsibility at this time to help to awaken others by continuously speaking the truth, even if we feel burdened by this task, even if we feel that nobody is listening, and even if it makes all people involved feel uncomfortable.

Nobody ever said that the truth is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside; the truth can be horrible, and yet, it needs to be embraced as a lover.

> "There are only two mistakes one can ever make on the path to truth; not starting, and not going all the way."
> &#x2A;Buddha, Religious leader.*

Lastly, we need practical real-world skills. The end goal isn't to have you just knowing this information for yourself; but to communicate this information to the masses. And to be able to communicate truth to others properly, knowledge and certain skills are required.

Technology is something that improves life for us, and makes life easier for us. In this technological era we live in, it is absolutely crucial that we learn to use this technology as our tools for communication of truth.

**Some examples of those practical skills are:**

- **Organization:** Whether it be a seminar, a meeting, or any other coming together of people.
- **Communication:** Good vocabulary, and choice of words; to communicate concepts clearly.
- **Graphic design:** For making power-point presentations, flyers, websites etc.
- **Presentation:** Whether in front of a group of friends, or an audience full of strangers.
- **Audio:** For making podcasts, or any other form of broadcasting audio.
- **Video:** For making compilations, vlogs, or any other form of video presentation.
- **Website** development: To accumulate your findings and make them accessible to the world.
- **Networking:** Can also be called 'people skills,' referring to direct communication.
- **Marketing & promotion:** To let others know where to find this information.

If most of us do not have these skills, we won't be reaching the optimum number of people. We have to become the new media, that is dedicated to truth, and put it out there for other people's edification.

## Moral Obligation

When we deeply understand knowledge as important as this, we almost have a moral obligation to share it with others; what gives us the right to keep it to ourselves? If it can greatly improve our own lives, and the lives of those around us.

## Outlet

If you keep taking in more and more knowledge, you're building up more and more pressure within yourself. If you don't have an outlet valve for that pressure, you become "Niagara Falls inside a water balloon," one day, it's going to burst.

# At the Crossroads

> “The Dark Ages still reign over all of humanity, and the depth and persistence of this domination are only now becoming clear. This dark age prison has no steel bars, chains, or locks. Instead, it is locked by disorientation and built on misinformation. Caught up in a plethora of conditioned reflexes and driven by the human ego, both warden and prisoner attempt merely to compete with God. All are intractably septical of what they do not understand. We are powerfully imprisoned in these dark ages simply by the terms in which we have been conditioned to think.” :br&#x2A;*Richard Buckminster Fuller, American Inventor.**

## Post Apocalyptic Era

We are living in 'Post-Apocalyptic' times, in the literal sense of the word. The word 'Apocalypse' is derived from the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek verb 'Calyptein (καλυπτειν)' which means 'to Cover / to Conceal,' hence the word apocalypse literally means 'to Reveal' or 'to Take out of hiding.' Therefore, the apocalypse simply means the revealing of truth. The veil has already been lifted, and the truth about what has been, and still is going on here on Earth is already out there, and available for most people to find.

## The Cosmic Apology

We have to make, what has been called "The Cosmic Apology". The word 'Apology' is made up of the Greek prefix 'Apo- (απο)' which means 'Away from / Off / Removed from' and the Greek noun 'Logos (λόγος)' which means 'Word.' Hence apology literally means 'to Go away from the word' (to take back something you said), or 'to Give back the word.' If a person says something they didn't really mean, or something they want to retract, they apologize; they are “moving away from” what they have said.

The Greek noun 'Logos' is derived from the Greek verb 'Lego (λεγω)' which means 'to Speak / to Say' (this is where the English word 'Lexicon' comes from). The Latin noun 'Lex / Legis (Law)' is also derived from this same Greek verb. God, not man, is the author (authority) of law; the one who brought the law into existence.

Humanity's work is to learn to listen to God's word, which is, Natural Law, spiritual law, moral law, God's law; and to align its behavior to that law.

Humanity must make this Cosmic Apology by giving the word (authorship of law) back to God, and collectively aligning its behavior with Natural Law. This is accomplished when we open our minds and hearts to truth, and when we start saying the lost word 'No' to those who claim to be our owners.

The very beginning of this guide started out with the chapter ["Before we begin"](https://doctrine.thefreemavens.org/fr/natural-law/before-we-begin).

Now we have begun -->

# Conclusion

> “The natural liberty of man is to be free from any superior power on Earth, and not to be under the will or legislative authority of man, but only to have the law of Nature for his rule."
> *John Locke, English philosopher*

> “Nature, to be commanded, must first be obeyed."
> *Francis Bacon, former Attorney General and Lord Chancellor of England*

If we want the forces of Nature on our side we must learn, and adhere to, the principles of Natural Law. If we do not align our behavior to it, Nature will not stand with us, but will continuously stand against us, and that will create more strife and suffering in our lives.

> “There is a law that man should love his neighbor as himself. In a few hundred years it should be as natural to mankind as breathing, or the upright gait. But if he does not learn it, he must perish."
> *Alfred Adler, Austrian Psychologist*

## The Master Key

This process should be able to be done a lot faster than a few hundred years; if we accept the master key that is shown in this guide. Which has the power to unlock all the locks, and all the doors, to all the mental cages, if we make the decision to climb the "ladder of consciousness" through an act of our own free will choice and effort. Because for most it won't be an easy process; it involves a lot of deep introspective work.

However, if we do this work, we can step out of the prisons we have imposed upon ourselves, by balancing the sacred feminine and sacred masculine forces within each one of us. And by recognizing our own inherent sovereignty, and recognizing there isn't, and never has been any legitimacy to slavery, control, authority or any other form of external rulership of human beings as subjects.

## Justice

The tarot card pictured here was also shown at the beginning of this guide. There is a deep connection to be understood about the tarot tradition and other mystery traditions regarding knowledge of Natural Law. Specifically, the deeply interwoven relationship to the Middle-Eastern Kabbalistic tradition.

This tarot card is known as the Justice Card (Justice: based on the Latin word &#x2A;**Jus*** meaning "Right or Law"). This card represents balance between the two pillars of Enlightenment (Feminine and Masculine), Holding the sword of truth in the right hand, and the scales of justice perfectly balanced in the left hand.

This Justice card represents sovereignty, alignment with truth, and the manifestation of order, which can only happen when we align our behaviors to the principles of Natural Law.

## True Freedom

If we let go of the habits that are holding us back and break the mental chains of bondage, we can create a world that is based on true freedom. It may be a difficult journey, but it can be done. And if we all choose to do so, we're going to see advances and creations beyond what we have ever experienced here on Earth. The world will look so drastically different if we go down that middle path to truth, order, and justice; the understanding, and applying of Natural Law. The changes we will experience are going to be so positive, and so transformative that we can barely even imagine what the world will look like on the other side of that work.

It is up to each and every one of us, personally, to take on that responsibility and go down that path for ourselves; should we hope to ever reach that point. The main task now is to inform as many people as possible about the workings of Natural Law, true morality, and freedom.
